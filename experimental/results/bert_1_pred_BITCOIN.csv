Nacho Flores,"It was amazing when I was spreading the word in Mexico back in 1993 about MP3, Compression, encryption, digital transmision, Internet Broadcast, etc. I was one of the few kids with a Personal Computer and Internet (Mexico City) in that time and my mind was blowing about such revolution. Perhaps today this terms or concepts are no longer fascinating because we live embedded in technology. That evolution took some time and I remember we fought against the system but here we are enjoying a Video Broadcast technology that uses all the concepts I mentioned. Same thing will occur with Bitcoin from now on. 

My first reaction 1 year ago about Bitcoin was like: No way! , finally something secure, open and very disrupting, f*** yeah !!. Since then, I am dedicating my time to spread the word about the use and benefits of Bitcoin, Blockchain and decentralized systems. 

In order to everyone can enjoy the promises of the Bitcoin technology we need to pass the info, to teach our friends, neighbors, customers how to use it how to take advantage and transform our financial system.

Jack Wu,"This is a really amazing video about cryptocurrency, and it explained it much better than any other video i could find. however, i got curious about how someone trying to commit fraud could succeed, and wanted to know how a system could deal with this kind of situation: 

Here we have 7 entities; Alice, Bob, Charlie, and 4 Miners. All 4 miners have roughly equal computing capabilities. Alice and Bob are not miners and cannot contribute computational work. We'll say Alice and Charlie are secretly two accounts belonging to the same person, although that is not critical to the situation.
Let's say Alice is attempting to commit fraud. Alice is paying Bob $100, and broadcasts that transaction to Bob, and only 2 of the miners. Alice broadcasts a fraudulent transaction, say Alice pays Charlie(Alice's own account) $100, to the other 2 miners.
Now Miners 1 and 2 have a correct block and Miners 3 and 4 have a fraudulent block that they think is accurate. 2 blocks with proof of work will be broadcast, one block with the correct transaction and one block with fraudulent transaction. We now have a fork in the road. The Miners will continue working on their current blockchain. However, since each side (Miners 1+2 and Miners 3+4) both have roughly the same amount of computational power, they can both contribute the same amount of work, and therefore the same amount of blocks. Because of this, no one fork will outpace the other, and both will maintain somewhat equal length.

This is where the confusion, especially for the Miners, sets in. Each fork will have roughly the same amount of blocks, and therefore, no one will know if they were working on the correct fork, or are still working off of the fraudulent transaction. Bob might know which is correct if he was expecting a transaction; he can look through the blocks at the beginning of each fork and determine that the block where he gets paid from Alice is accurate. But even then, since Bob has no computational power, he cannot contribute work to the correct chain in an attempt to prove that is the correct chain. To top it all off, Charlie can even claim he was expecting a transaction from Alice.

So even if Bob picks up what is happening, how will the Miners? How can they settle which fork is correct? All comments are appreciated, I'm just really curious how a cryptocurrency could combat this.",https://yt3.ggpht.com/-E4r-DkP_0nA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/nRBcSmtK7os/s28-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg,bBC-nXj3Ng4,2018-10-05T18:35:31.000Z,joy

Hari Tadepalli,"Excellent Tutorial. Most popular expositions and even academic publications raise more questions than provide answers to the readers. 

Distributed consensus as a fundamental construct of building block chains is a relatively new concept (though distributed consensus algorithms have been around for long). 

One perplexing question - in the event of double spend attack, consider scenario where a malicious miner M pays two other parties A and B with the same bit coin. With sufficient computing power, M can fool his network to believe that only the M->A transfer has happened and M->B did not happen, since it never got registered in the block chain. While other players in the network may not notice that B is cheated, why would B ignore this fact - given that B observes that the M->B transaction never had a chance to be recorded block chain?",https://yt3.ggpht.com/-v1iHh9Vtj7s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/jdD_rS1iwlg/s28-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg,bBC-nXj3Ng4,2018-07-20T18:35:43.000Z,anger

Matthew Leitch,"The video says some things about Bitcoin that are false and important. Most importantly, it says that paying with Bitcoin is cheaper, quicker, and easier than other methods. The truth is that Bitcoin payments are many times more costly than, say, using your debit card, many times slower,  and much more fiddly. The reason is fundamental inefficiency in the design of Bitcoin. The blockchain that records all transactions ever made is copied thousands of times (though not one copy for every user as the video incorrectly says) so the work of recording transactions is duplicated thousands of times. It also takes quite a long time for copies of updates to be passed around to enough copies to be reliably recorded. There is also the extra processing required by the 'proof of work' mechanisms, where computers race each other to solve an arithmetic problem first and earn bitcoins. This is a big part of the inefficiency problem. The electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network is already greater than some countries and anyone who cares about the environment should be concerned by this. It is also not true that university fees can be paid by Bitcoin. There may be some universities where that is true but it isn't generally true.",https://yt3.ggpht.com/-o-DN95g5mvs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/8b8i5amyR-M/s28-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg,s4g1XFU8Gto,2018-05-28T09:27:03.000Z,fear

Noelkinz / Mad Lab Rhythms,"The way I see it : it's basically another exchange system for products & services thats is not getting recorded by a middleman (like a bank) who has the information about the transactions made. Is like a digital dollar, that you can use for products digitally just like a credit card with the exception that you are paying directly & what gives value to it depends on how much is in circulation just like the normal dollar but there is no bank holding that information. That's the basic idea but right now as attractive as it sounds I don't support it fully since I know a lot of people are using this currency in the black market to hide there identity as a way to buy guns, drugs & & child prostitution like laundering money or blood money. so until I don't see any type of moral & ethical control to it, I cannot see any benefits to this.

Rafael N.,"Descentralized means ( orbiting around the earth with no connection ) great for bitcoin, but a crypto world that is totally imposible to regulate, because it lives in space, it is doomed to stay there, in a non country space.
The crypto world today is nothing more than an outer space las vegas, that has quit its connections to earth .Because  there is no way to rule in space, then is no way of being legit. No matter how hard governments try to regulate it. They can regulate the airports that take you in and out of that space but nothing more. 
Crypto world would be left there by governments , and it would orbit into the oblivion. Forever
Descentralize= no country= no rules= no contracts= no warranty.
Good for bitcoin ? Yes, as a store if value alternative to the ones in earth .but converting to dollars will always be require to be inside the law.

That the citizen is here to be regulated by the government and that it is reasonable and normal for the relationship to be like that.

Alan Land,"So how does bitcoin scale to the less affluent user. Current wallet to wallet transactions in bitcoin are upwards of $3.00USD. That is fine if I am transmitting $1000s, about the same as VISA if I am transmitting $100s, but a stiff penalty if I am transmitting $10s of dollars or less.

Greg Collins,"I'm still dubious about bitcoin as money.   Because money has three purposes:
1:  a medium of exchange
2:  a measure of value
3:  a store of value

The bottom line is as he says, money needs to be trusted in order to be good.   A hallmark of good money that can be trusted is that it has stable value.  If the value of your money fluctuates all over the place - that makes it less valuable as money.   
While I think bitcoin is addressing a serious flaw in the current currency in use (whether central/governmental control of money can be trusted), I don't see that the value of bitcoin can be trusted.  Yes, bitcoin, when it becomes commonplace will be a great medium of exchange - but not so great on counts 2 and 3.  The value of a bitcoin is fluctuating and the subsequent measure of the pricing of goods and services will not be stable.  The quantity of bitcoin money is fluctuating and hard to trust - and even if it were, how many other cryptocurrencies will rise up to inflate the money supply without control?  And as he says, bitcoin has no intrinsic value - only a speculative value based on market action.
One of the key indicia of a successful economy is stable money.  It just kills me when I hear on the news that ""an item some years ago sold for X dollars which would now be Y dollars"".   Nobody knows how much anything is worth anymore and Bitcoin is not going to solve that problem.  
Please enlighten me on how Bitcoin is going to restore stable pricing.....",https://yt3.ggpht.com/-UBeHUYohAUs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/CLdJsM99fJM/s28-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg,UlKZ83REIkA,2017-06-02T14:29:58.000Z,joy

MK,Slide Commitment API: What's the purpose of the key? The only thing you publish at beginning is commitment. Message is kept secret until opening envelope. So you can easily do only com=h(msg) and publish com. Nobody can reveal msg from com. Message originator can't forge original message because he can't find msg' with the same hash h(msg)=h(msg'). Everything works without the key as well. All you need is clear hash.,https://yt3.ggpht.com/-4SAaxTDLOTE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/KiVqfdKPTSU/s28-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg,fOMVZXLjKYo,2017-03-07T16:07:19.000Z,joy

Lanny Bianchi,This more last sounds like what they did back in the twenties and thirties what they did was anyone who had a printing press and this was going on in the United States could print their own currency they had so many banks that One Bank wouldn't honor another Banks currency because it wasn't back by any type of commodity such as gold silver copper Cole or oil something to have some sort of commodity to it I don't see where this Bitcoin is holding any type of commodity where's the commodity at back in the twenties and thirties when people were printing their own money and everything like that as I was saying you had banks that wouldn't honor other Banks money and that was part of the reason of the stock market crash but it wasn't the whole reason farmers basically faltered on loans that they made and one pay the bank and then turned around and blame the banks for the reason why their crops failed and the reason why their crops failed was because Farmers that know how to basically Farm their land they cut down all the trees and the swell would die and they weren't making any money to pay the bank note and then you had these people who are print their own money I mean you had so many banks out there that it was unbelievable after all that FDIC came in and change the banking regulations that made money backed by gold and silver or some sort of commodity but what this guy is saying just Bitcoin has really no commodity to it whatsoever he's talking about a mathematical problem being solved how's that a commodity I predict this and this is what's going to happen you going to have millions of people investing in this Bitcoin and these other coins and 81012 years down the road it's going to come out that these coins are absolutely worthless it's the same thing that happened during the stock market crash when the banks failed very same thing you had people printing money that was not backed by any type of commodity and there was no FDIC to ensure that money the one thing about the JP Morgan silver dollar was the fact that it had 90% silver in it that's your commodity right there that's my Bank of America was allowed to stay afloat because it had silver it had a commodity it's Bitcoin really doesn't have anything in it any of you want to basically look at history and look at it how people were printing their own money and everything like this this is a Xerox copy of that plan what they did back in the twenties and thirties is what they're doing right now with his Bitcoin,https://yt3.ggpht.com/-TVqhG1pjkxc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/m3Cayv8tbp4/s28-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg,cFj72hrUZt4,2018-09-06T01:00:56.000Z,joy

Vinson Lin,"If BTC saved thousands of peoples lives each year, and cuts down on impact upon nature by 97%.
Then this is Progressive and saving the planet!

Also, mining BTC will be over within 70 years. Then their will never be a need for mining again. However, FIAT will need to be mined the metal, forest cut, toxic ink, troops transports and bank robberies for the next 10,000 years at least.
70 years, and no more mining BTC ever again. Only 21-million will ever be minted.

Also, 3% of BTC has been used for drug's. While a staggering 87% of USD has been used for drugs. And 83% of USD has drug residue physically on them, harming little children. No BTC ever has any drug residue on them. Also, almost all drug bust around the world also include massive amounts of untraceable United States Dollars on hand.

Global Turbo Team - Systems That Serve,"BitClub Network now faces the problem that it violates securities laws not only in the USA but also in other countries. Russ Medlin is American and violating US securities laws. Many of the top BitClub Network leaders are also American and blatantly violating US securities laws and promoting for others also to violate the laws. Genesis Mining was hit with a Cease and Desist in the US, and BCN is on the list. Any American marketing BCN is likewise subject to SEC rules. Russ lives in the Philippines where BCN is also inconsistent with Philippine SEC rulings. This is a disaster waiting to happen.

Sachin Garud,"Friends, please don't try to mine bitcoin on your laptop or mobile. Because algorithms of verification process are so rapidly running that can make your device non functional due to heavy load of a data. Also stay away from cloud mining schemes around. Chances that they may run away once you give them your bitcoin for cloud mining. Because most of them are ponzi schemes. I repeat bitcoin is not a ponzi thing. People those who r doing mis businesses by using word bitcoin are ponzi. Just buy a Bitcoin from any exchange like Zebpay, unocoin and forget about your investment for 2 years. Dont do its trading too. Bitcoin will give you potentially positive results just by keeping it for a months. Don't look in a short term way. Look for a long term. You will definitely get good results.",https://yt3.ggpht.com/-_b6MKuzgPnk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/_Xl2592lFK4/s28-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg,yIP4Py6WyKo,2017-12-28T04:08:37.000Z,joy

Ash Jain,one of the premises of currency is stability. just from the graph you can see the wild ride one has to go through. therefore it cannot be a currency and it's just nothing but speculation just as you would buy a stock or Bond or even gold or silver. you may come out ahead or may not but it doesn't give you True Value for your fruits of Labor and all this speaker is trying to do is hype to promote his own company as he's the middleman and stands to profit from increased activity. total garbage and not a reason objective viewpoint or presentation.

Aliensyntax,"What exactly are the disadvantages / trade-offs driving this advertised scaling increase? I'm still very skeptical this system is all it's cracked up to be. I understand the network uses ""probabilistic"" proof-of-work. I understand it eliminates miners and replaces them with transaction senders. I understand the transaction senders are also the transaction verifiers. What I fail to understand is how this protocol improves on the consensus, economic, and security features of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake protocols. Clearly, you can't get this kind of transaction throughput without significant design trade-offs. What are those trade-offs? 

It sounds like this system is very susceptible to Sybil attacks. As the transaction senders are also the verifiers, the network will require a very large pool of transaction senders to be online at every moment to mitigate the possibility of consensus attacks. I don't see what prevents an attacker from periodically spinning up a few thousand malicious nodes to overpower the network.

And if there were a consensus fault, how would IOTA even know without a notion of global state? Clearly, there can't be a global state unless the state is replicated throughout the network. But then how can the state be replicated if the transaction output is as massive as IOTA promises? Where is that data stored? How is that data stored? And what incentivizes the storage of data? Does IOTA shard the global state of the ""tangle"" across different subsets of the network? What exactly ensures consistency in that case? And if there's strong consistency, how then does the network guarantee availability and partition tolerance? 

Is it correct to assume the nodes can't agree on a new version of the software? It sounds like IOTA can't be upgraded as it can't perform soft- / hard-forks. Is there some alternate decentralized consensus mechanism to adapt to changing conditions? That hasn't been explained in the slightest from the presentations I've come across. How are such fixes and updates incorporated?

Finally, how precisely was the IOTA cryptocurrency distributed? It seems as though you guys were in stealth mode for ages and then suddenly, practically overnight, became valued at close to 2 billion. That doesn't sound remotely healthy for distribution. To be perfectly frank, it sounds like a pump and dump. How are you addressing these concerns? Your devs don't seem very public.",https://yt3.ggpht.com/-23qqXQDLr_c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/qQmD43dLKm8/s28-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg,j6EPdNb-K8Y,2017-06-15T00:30:20.000Z,sadness

abinaderus,"Bitcoin is merely a much higher-tech currency that was created to forcibly move the world faster (with warp speed) toward a computerized one world currency, which will also be controlled the same way (with RFID), in an absolute foolproof way in its final form.

That is why bitcoin was created anonymously. No individual created bitcoin, rest assured on that. It is amazing that in people's greed, nobody (like with 9-11) seems to know or care what the truth is concerning the origin of the issue. They just jumped in headfirst, like rats, because there were big profits to make with the invention of bitcoin.

Tools for moving currencies - like credit/debit cards, wire transfers, PayPal, will all give way to RFID. Bitcoin represents a much closer step toward computer-controlled world currency, and RFID the same as the means to control the flow/stock of the one-world currency.

RFID is the final tool for the financial future, just as a single, one-world currency is the final currency. They are now RFID chipping 100s of people in Sweden for medical reasons, they have chipped some of the US military, but eventually RFID will include all your basic info, including a unique ID, your financial info, your education and work history, and so on, at which time RFID will become the final ""debit card,"" implanted in your right hand or forehead. A few years ago, even the US Congress quietly passed a law making taking the RFID chip ""voluntary,"" once it comes into being! By then, of course, it will be a choice of taking the RFID chip, or else no buying or selling of any kind.

Everything is in place via the five-story-tall EC ""Big Brother"" supercomputer in Brussels to do this right now (every person alive is in their database right now!), as is the banking system now capable of implementing both RFID and a world currency. All that is missing is the man who puts it all together.

And what will bring in RFID?

The US has been the oil reserve currency, ever since Kissinger made the deal with the Saudis in 1970. Meaning, all purchases in oil anywhere are made in US dollars. The US is also the world reserve currency. Both of these create false demand for the dollar, but the world is sick of our $125 trillion in unfunded liabilities, and our $17 trillion in national debt, and US imperialism, and today as a result (as you know) the dollar is being bypassed more and more in world trade. These black markets will soon become white markets, as world approval grows.

Last year, China bought 90% of the world output of gold, and now has over half the gold needed to begin minting a gold-backed yuan. A gold-backed yuan would destroy the dollar overnight, because once major nations no longer accept the dollar as world oil/reserve currency, the US balance sheet will INSTANTLY dictate the value of our worthless fiat currency.

Add to that, China is not interested in the UN's proposed world ""basket"" of currencies becoming the international standard (dollar, ruble, yuan, euro), because China has the only truly growing economy, the only significant surpluses, and also the goal of world domination. If the dollar crashed, the US would have no choice but to comply to China's every demand.

As countries (like Syria, North Korea, Russia, China) bypass/eliminate the dollar in their trade, the need for a universally-accepted one-world currency escalates, and RFID is the one foolproof tool to support such an international currency. If you want to know for sure that this is going to happen, and who will implement RFID and the world currency, open your bible and read Revelation, chapter 13, especially verses 16-18. As things develop, people will finally realize that the bible is exact, and easy to understand
