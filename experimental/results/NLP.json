When writing a scientific article or instruction manual, you want to be as precise as possible with your use of words, terms and grammer and to minimize the chance of missunderanding to be as small as possible. \n\nThat is why, even if computers could understand natural language, the degrees of complexity of the tasks which they could pull off would inevitably be affected by the accuracy of the instructions(macros and preprogrammed sequences and programs are of course exempted).","emotion":"anger"},

I am creating my own algorhythms that match the verbal content to a specific graphics-animation algo, which would be executed through javascript. \n\n I am essentially creating my own language classification that is related to visual elements. I am a relative beginner and my question is essentially how does one structure the architecture so that the nltk will be able to analyze the user text input, return variable to which it belongs. and then go into the javascript to connect with the graphics algo,( because the linguistic classification will determine the order of the graphics display)\n\nI was starting with NLTK and Python but then ended up using a simple library for now (NLP compromise) because I am not doing statistical analysis as of yet, I just want to be able to start connecting works and expressions to the graphics, which is easier with JS at this early stage since I am using the browser to display everything. \n\nIt's just not clear to me how I can connect Python/NLTK to the browser to use it live, and if it's at all possible to use it \"live\".","emotion":"joy"},
