This is why for instance when it comes to the sciences there is such a heavy emphasis on exact word use. When writing a scientific article or instruction manual, you want to be as precise as possible with your use of words, terms and grammer and to minimize the chance of missunderanding to be as small as possible. 

That is why, even if computers could understand natural language, the degrees of complexity of the tasks which they could pull off would inevitably be affected by the accuracy of the instructions(macros and preprogrammed sequences and programs are of course exempted)."

Syntax is basically mathematics & logic. Psycholinguistics uses neurobiology. and those are only a few of the branches within the study of Linguistics. Linguistics, in the broad, all-encompassing sense is generally deemed a ""humanities"" study, except maybe by MIT)."

As you said, if u know the word u said, and the word u said before, then u can figure out the next word. (LIKE A MARKOW CHAIN). Insted of RNN, why not let the loop connect itself externally.... the 2 words u say can come as input to the neural network from the ear.... because u said the words....and u can hear yourself...so the words come as input using an ear. This must be an even more basic approach then having internal loops in the NN."

What would be cooler would be if, instead of statistics, this thing used grammar patterns. eg. ""met"" is a past participle of ""meet""; but the infinitive form ""meet"" is required following ""Let's"", so based off of that it'd change the word. Then again, this wouldn't work for general misspellings.

But still, for grammar check, this'd be cool."

An analogy: compare GMail to running your own mail server.  You only need to scale hardware when you scale users.

The Wave technology is not data-intensive until you scale it to the millions of users that Google serves.  Your garage machine and home cable networking should have no trouble handling several dozen active waves (and hundreds of inactive ones) with several participants each.

Remember- we're talking Google here, not Microsoft.  Lean software is the modus operandi."

If you can't run spelly on your server then don't. It sounds like it will be trivial to make your own spell checking robot to replace spelly, or not use spelly at all.

It's a very good tool to categorize people according to their speech. You can put person A into, let's say a capitalist, while person B into, let's say a socialist simply by taking their common used words and the ""passion / positivity"" of the word commonly used by capitalist / socialist. It's one of the tool China used to censor people. Like any technology, it can be used for good or bad. The problem with speech is that it maybe sarcastic, that is where NLP still fail."

I have a question and I am not  sure where to go to: I am using NLP to analyze language and match it to specific graphics.  Users would enter text and then the text would display graphics according to both the actual word and syntax.  I am creating my own algorhythms that match the verbal content to a specific graphics-animation algo, which would be executed through javascript. 

 I am essentially creating my own language classification that is related to visual elements. I am a relative beginner and my question is essentially how does one structure the architecture so that the nltk will be able to analyze the user text input, return variable to which it belongs. and then go into the javascript to connect with the graphics algo,( because the linguistic classification will determine the order of the graphics display)

I was starting with NLTK and Python but then ended up using a simple library for now (NLP compromise) because I am not doing statistical analysis as of yet, I just want to be able to start connecting works and expressions to the graphics, which is easier with JS at this early stage since I am using the browser to display everything. 

It's just not clear to me how I can connect Python/NLTK to the browser to use it live, and if it's at all possible to use it ""live""."

I have a need where I need to check a customer's email (or say convert the phone call to speech which I will do using another software) and then from that find out 2 things.
1. Sentiment analysis
2. Was the email or call related to say a topic called XYZ (I donnot say..related to some catgory )

I have a list of 2 files...
1. training  model with phrases which tell me if the customer is happy or sad....
2. training model with  phrases that show if the call or email is related to topic XYZ


now from the last 4 videos in this series what I understand is that

1. I first do processing of my text using NLTK (from chapter 1 to 14)
2. provide #1 as input to  scikit learn and do the analysis

Please let me know if I understood this right...

also...if my training models (say list of phrases which tell me if the customer is happy) has stop words...should, I rather remove the stop words from the training model in the first place ?
say ""I'm going to cancel"" means customer is not happy and should it rather be ""cancel"" in the training model or should it be the phrase ""I'm going to cancel""?

again...still going through all the videos and apologies for jumping the gun -:)
