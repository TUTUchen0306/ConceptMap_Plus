UgzSZ2vrqK7-7bmNtcZ4AaABAg,0,vN30emwcNS4,"I can understand why people have COVID fatigue.......listening to doctors discuss the range of diagnostic tests via super technical medical terminology in order to comprehend infection, transmission, diagnoses, prevention, containment, treatment, therapies, etc can make your head spin.  I suppose that's because when COVID sets in, it travels with such ease to several vital organs, and can affect multiple organ systems at once, complicating everything.  

Some things just don't have an EASY button to them; mysterious illnesses like this one are near the top.  I was actually at Mayo briefly around the beginning of COVID and received vaccines. I've been negative ever since, but I'm not sure I trust the tests.  However, it seems like the efficacy is going to wane eventually, and with take-home kits taking over, it'll just be scout's honor that everyone's status remains negative.

I'm taking a blood thinner for now to reduce the possibility of clotting.",2022-04-25T04:21:12Z,Darren Walters,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQZi1lx79epUensVaVg3lS4JDmakxPu4NNDQn0e3Q=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgxMQshgzqDafHzSdHh4AaABAg,0,vN30emwcNS4,"I got covid last sunday. Didn't get the vaccines. Here's how it's gone so far:

- There was chills and mild fever on the first day. It started with a feeling of nausea but I didn't vomit.
- The second day the fever had lowered but I welt tired and a bit achy.
- The third day the fever was gone and I was feeling pretty good, some runny nose and a bit of a cough.
- The fourth day was similar to the the day before but the cough got a bit worse over the evening.
- Now I'm on my fifth day and I feel otherwise fine but there's some chest congestion and there's a need to cough to clear it up. It gets a bit more congested when sleeping.

I have a pulse oximeter and the oxygen levels are great (99-98%) but pulse is a bit high (80-90). I hope the cough/congestion doesn't get too bad. I have a tendency of getting a nasty cough and a need of clearing up the lungs in the morning even with regular viruses, so I dunno if it's a good sign or not. In other hand this feels very typical respitory illness, but you never know if it gets worse.",2022-01-27T17:15:53Z,Moshugaani,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTFU51Rn5crKVRUDyLT_Iw2uIM4jWyAr4EL1bIo=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

When the scientists eradicated many deadly viruses like Small Pox, Polio etc., people believed in its benefits.  Due to some selfish politicians, this trust has been destroyed!
It is OK for people to run to the hospital to seek medical care when they are suffering from Covid-19, but it NOT OK to take the vaccine and prevent them from running to the hospital.

Ugw2uJeeXhY6zGm9bJJ4AaABAg,0,vN30emwcNS4,"Thank you both. I just found out after feeling nauseous, my left arm hurting and severe sweating. Then, going to the emergency. That I have Covid. I opened my home to a person I trusted. Without making sure this person wore a mask and within two days of allowing this person to stay at my home, I got sick. As an Asthamtic, I made the decision to get vaccinated, and I'm thankful I did. I stayed at the hospital for 8 hours and was isolated, of course. I invited the person in my home on the 8th and on the 10th of January 2022. I was sick. This new Omicron spreads like a wild fire. For two years and almost two weeks, Covid never entered my home or body. Be careful who you let in your home and make people wear a mask and get tested. My symptoms are severe headaches but not a normal headache. But a beyond painful headache, fever 102.5, now two days later, my temp is 100, but it goes up and down. At least I know my body is fighting this virus; chills beyond, oh, how I hate feeling cold because it's hard to get warm. But that's part of the fever. Severe coughing with yellow/greenish phlegm. But at least it's coming out. Body aches, but I push myself to move my body. I can feel the virus attacking various parts of my body; every day is different. From my eyes hurting to my ears hurting, to my knees hurting, it's a strange virus, and it pops up in various unusual places on your body. I even have a bruise on my top inner arm. That's weird. Not taking much fever meds. I want the fever to do its thing and fight Mr Covid. In saying that, drink tea, eat soup, drink fluids, and buy medicine that will loosen the phlegm. I have experienced close to serious coughing spells. That's not fun. But vacation in your room and wear an N95 mask when you leave your bedroom. I have teenagers in my home and adults. Call your doctor for a Zpack if you feel it's getting worse. Rest watch movies catch up on your reading and listen to some good music. PS: If you choose not to get vaccinated, your choice. I chose what was best for me. üòä",2022-01-14T14:22:35Z,Sunshine,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRkGQMjbbu9nIkCjtGaaf2yXUyT47lTqo4s6NgU2A=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

 You are not going to hide from covid with a mask.  You have to have covid to give it and EVERYONE wearing a mask is a blatant over reach not based on science with a maybe 15% efficacy.
Developing a strong immune system and proactive strategies over antiquated and ineffectual mask wearing.

There are 6 other people in that same office that day. The lady with cough told me Betty White may have died because she had the booster 3 days before. I asked where did she hear  that? She said name of website I recognized as right wing on youtube.. I laughed a little and said I'll wait to see what the Coroners report says before believing that. She then said Main stream media won't report that, if it was the booster. I let it drop. I ask about another hygienist from there that I didn't see that day. She told me she is out sick. All the while she is still coughing everyone there must be hearing her coughing. on the way out to pay my bill her and two others, one office secretary and another hygienist. NONE have masks on while this lady is coughing. Even during my exam with Dr's hands in my mouth she was just out of sight to my left, Coughing, I'm a little concerned but she has her mask on right? for a one second break from his hands in my mouth I turn a little and see she isn't wearing her mask correctly, It was pulled way down with half her mouth visible. Felt like the twilight zone, Is the entire office think like she does? I am immunized and just had my booster but if the other hygienist  is out with covid and this office its common to not wear masks at all during their interactions in close quarters or properly They could be giving it to all their patients and their families.

My son had Covid-19 last year. It was considered a mild case with a fever of 99 to 100 degrees for 5 days. No lung issues only headache, fatigue, and body aches. He is 24 yrs old. He had been on a regiment of  vitamins  D3, C, and zinc before he contracted  Covid. He increased his vitamin D3 to  20,000's a day while he was sick. He started takeing Nac , Quercetin & 12 sprays of ACS 200  Advanced Cellular Silver 2x a day while he was sick.
He also did hydro therapy  for 3 days at the start of his symptoms. His fever broke on the 5th day! It took 7 days for him to get his test results back for the tasting site. They came back positive for Covid-19. 
Thank you so much for all the information you provided!üôè

I‚Äôve been taking 5,000 IUs daily for 5 yrs. in 2019, I started having upper back burning. Had a bunch of imaging done which culminated with a spinal MRI. They saw all sorts of sub-centimeter nodules throughout my spine, one in my sternum and one in my sacrum. We thought cancer! Had two of them biopsied‚Äîboth were granulomas. I was then presumed to have sarcoidosis, even though my lungs did not show classic sarcoidosis. I was referred to a sarcoidosis specialist for routine monitoring and have never had to be out on any medication. 

We‚Äôve followed the nodules with subsequent imaging for 2.5 yrs just to be safe. No change except that many have disappeared, including some that were in my spleen.

However granulomas once formed can cause elevation in calcium levels (via a vit D like compound) and so it is not recommended to supplement extensively with vitamin D in these situations.

week 1-Day 1: Sore throat develops
week 2: Sore throat more severe, my lymph nodes on my neck are swollen, more than they've ever been!
week 3, --Day 15: Sore throat subsiding, now cold symptoms take over; runny nose, congestion, 
Day 16: More nasal congestion, sneezing, runny nose...I have COMPLETELY lost my sense of taste and smell! I mean, its completely gone!! (Don't Panic)
Day 17:--Body aches, my bones feel tired, i feel weak, have fever, and cold symptoms still
Day 18; Same as Day 17
Day 19: Same as day 18
Day 20:  Extremely tired! Feel exhausted, i cant even go shopping at Wal mart, I fell asleep in my car in the parking lot at Walmart for an hour! Just drove home, feel really tired
Day 21: Have slightly more energy, still have fever, cold symptoms--I Test Positive for Covid !!!
Day 22:  Feel like the cold symptoms are subsiding, I no longer have a fever!
Day 23: The end of the cold symptoms are near, feel much better, still have raspy throat, slight cough, partial sense of smell returning
Day 24: Same as day 23
Day 25-29: Getting back to normal, no more cold symptoms, smell and taste are getting better!
Day 30:--Almost completely back to normal, I have about 70% of my smell and taste senses back. Very slight cough, I have a small spot in the back of my throat that still ""irritates"" when i drink something hot, but definitely 90% better, and also glad I came through this now! I should be immune to Covid now :)

Ya'll hang in there! Its basically a bad cold/flu. It will pass! Praise the Lord, I'm very thankful that my taste and smell have mostly returned, I just love food!

I got infected 2019 in the first 3 months of the pandemic and I ONLY survived because I was ""lucky"" and most likely had a very good immune system at the time. I just drank lots of liquids, rested, did my vitamins, drank meds ONLY if I felt sick (like the normal meds you take for fever and etc.). My appetite was shot, so I lost 20lbs after I recovered totally after a few weeks. I was very careful with my self and told myself I would rush to the hospital if it got worse (thankfully, it did not). Don't go for full natural remedies and treatments for this.

Coughing here and there for 3 weeks.  I was able to get body aches and fever under control with acetaminophen and ibuprofen 3x daily. Perhaps body aches and persistent fever symptoms due to cytokine storm? Anyway, this allowed me to get sleep -- the best medicine Im allowed in Phascist Utopia. 4 weeks later I am 100%.

We also have a glass of warm water with 1 teaspoon  Honey and a few sprinkles of Ginger n cinnamon powders. As soon as we wake up we drink a glass of hot water (not burning or boiling) as a cleansing process of our digestive systems.  We also are very careful with throat infection. We don‚Äôt just ignore and delay in treating our throat infection. One slight delay will worsen the mild symptom of Corona virus. We have learned from past mistakes.. We drink lots of warm water and avoid eating deep fried and oily food, and no cold drinks.  We have been using these methods and our family members stay healthy.  We have two grown up youngsters with history of Asthma. They have outgrown asthma but are still very cautious about taking the right diets, and warn drinks.  Good Ventilation in our home  is ultimately important.  I have noticed most offices have no ventilation and employees never open their windows, Early morning before they start work. Just imagine the day before, the offices are all filled with stale carbon dioxide exhaled by everyone on the premises. The following day, everyone going into the workplace will be inhaling all the stale air.  This process is repeatedly taking place every day without the stale air being cleansed..",2021-09-09T09:08:47Z,Bojoon Dong,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTYSh7iRjzkDR6uFCgawRA8O8e1tULlvEGZkQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

I‚Äôm wondering why you didn‚Äôt mention Ivermectin?
Also, about cracking a window‚Ä¶I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre referring to it being cold outside & therefore people have all their windows closed?  Or, do you mean that all the windows are closed because it‚Äôs hot outside & the ac is on in the house?
If it‚Äôs the latter, wouldn‚Äôt the ac cause the air to circulate?  Or is the cracked window a way to get NEW fresh air inside?
You also mentioned to continue wearing a mask outside. Why would that be important, if fresh air is what you‚Äôd need?  
Masks prevent lots of real fresh air from getting to your lungs. It seems you‚Äôre breathing all sorts of things that are in & on the mask, preventing pure fresh air from getting into your lungs. 
PS. A help to all the non-medical people‚Ä¶Most of the time you explain in ‚Äúplain fEnglish‚Äù, what you say in medical terms, but sometimes you don‚Äôt. And, even when you‚Äôre speaking in easier to understand terms, it‚Äôs still foreign to many.

UgzHR5SSIn4YdT84HPp4AaABAg,0,vN30emwcNS4,"I am writing this comment from the perspective of a concerned citizen who has successfully managed her health throughout adulthood without the aid of vaccines. I might add that I survived virtually every contagious childhood disease, such as measles, mumps, rubella, etc., and have gained stronger and longer lasting immunity than a person can acquire with a vaccination. As a healthy and fit 69-year-old woman, I aim to stay that way.

It is clear from the many scientifically sound studies, whose results have been published in natural medicine journals, that it is possible to treat most viral diseases with safe and effective natural alternatives if treatment commences in the early stages. To deliberately attempt to deny access to this information in order to subject a greater number of people to an experimental vaccine is a violation of the principle of informed consent, which states that people must know about all options before undergoing a treatment or procedure. It is also a violation of the principle of patient autonomy, which articulates the right of patients to refuse treatment and to refuse participation in any experiment.

Unfortunately, there have been many documented attempts to sllence doctors, nurses, researchers, and concerned citizens who are informing the public about the many available options. The exception to informed consent, known as ""implied informed consent,"" that would apply in an emergency situation involving, for example, an unconscious person without the capacity to give consent is not relevant in the current scenario. 

It is rapidly becoming apparent that the COVID vaccines confer risk for all people, and a much higher risk of harm for certain populations, yet in many cases these persons are not made aware by the clinics administering the injections. The result is unnecessary injury or death. I believe that, at this point, the matter has escalated from a breach of medical ethics to a crime.  For that reason, in support of the citizen petition filed by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Meryl Nass, M.D., on behalf of Children's Health Defense, I ask that the government not mandate or license COVID vaccines.",2021-07-05T00:49:47Z,SilkeFauve,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSn8AbUg0BAxQ4nvUQJ8AFHpSqQlez78_iW0Z0Z=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

If you expose your body to the sun for 20-30 min without sunscreen and at noon, you will get 10,000 UI, then your boy shuts down the vitamin D production.

I also have some kidney protein leakage but not too bad at this point so that being said I am completely scared of corona virus getting the best of me.  I found a family member with the virus late last year so we all were tested by nasal swabbing.  My next day results came back negative.  I have always had shortness of breath Which gets worse over the years so I worry and fear catching the virus knowing what it will do to me. Last week I went for a full blood screening test ordered by my primary physician and the results just yesterday showed I actually had the virus at some point because I had the antibodies in my system yet again that test was a negative.  So I am/was asymptomatic entirely because I did not feel sick or show symptoms of the virus AT ALL.  I am so shocked and stunned trying to determine the when and where I had this virus.  Same with my boyfriend who also tested negative yet he never felt any symptoms because if I had it - then we both had it.  During the few months that I would have had this virus both my boyfriend and I were taking lengthy baths nightly since the place we were living had the luxury of a bathtub.  Although we had no fevers, we were taking warm baths and warm/hot showers daily just for the luxury of having the tub.  My boyfriend is completely healthy for his age and I take certain meds of course however none are any specified here or vitamins mentioned here either.

The agent promotes SIRT2, which then inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly involved with COVID-19 infection, said Samuel F. Yanuck, DC, of the Program on Integrative Medicine at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill School of Medicine, who co-authored a review of emerging research on the subject. It also plays a role in facilitating zinc transportation across lipid membranes, Yanuck said.

In cell cultures, quercetin has been shown to prevent viral entry and reduce the cytopathic effects of many viruses, including rhinovirus and poliovirus. In a 2016 animal study, rodents administered quercetin before being exposed to a lethal load of Ebola virus survived

Using this rationale, researchers are postulating that vitamin C should be administered with quercetin because it can recycle oxidized quercetin, producing a synergistic effect and enhancing quercetin's antiviralpcapability, Biancatelli added.
After the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus outbreak, researchers in China found quercetin and other small molecules bound to the spike protein of the virus, interfering with its ability to infect host cells.

Human Studies
The signal from the SARS-CoV-1 study led researcher Hasan √ñnal, MD, and co-authors to conduct an open-label randomized control trial in Turkey examining quercetin's role in COVID-19. In the trial, 95 patients with COVID-19 are receiving a 1,000-mg active treatment dose and 113 healthcare workers are receiving a 500-mg dose as prophylaxis. In both treatment arms, quercetin is administered with vitamin C and bromelain, a supplement extracted from pineapples that is used for burns or inflammation.
As of March, no COVID-19 cases were recorded among healthcare workers taking prophylactic quercetin and no deaths were observed .",2021-03-18T05:49:12Z,Kitty Cat,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRWMGEGQc5wzqzjLv_UrykG7CwsaiMU8Jfeb_pdDGQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

I also got a pneumonia shot and later a flu shot. My BMI is around 33. Well, I got COVID about the same time as former Pres Trump and I read what his doctors gave him. So, I continued to take Vit D and added Zn, a baby aspirin, and melatonin, and purchased an oximeter. I did not use any fever-reducing medication and let my body sweat plus I took lots of really hot baths. My oxygen dropped to 90-91% and my heart raced. Now, my BP is up 156/92 and I have a little bit of lung scarring and an abnormal EKG. After watching your video, I am planning to visit my NP and add Mg, I also have dropped 15 pounds so my BMI should improve. I am a white, 66-year-old female. Your video gave me GREAT reassurance that some of my pre and post-COVID steps probably helped me. (HA!

UgxxiHVKsu279vFwN314AaABAg,0,vN30emwcNS4,Thank you very much for posting this helpful video. There are two issues I'd like to raise.1) Here in the UK our medical professionals are not trained in nutritional medicine or in supplements. Indeed mine said there are no clinical studies of them! The receive only a few hours during their 7 year training and that about severe nutritional/ vitamin deficiencies. So we cannot get advice from them. We rely on information from researchers and practitioners like yourself. So we are grateful to you and others like you posting their videos. 2) Could you comment on the use of UV lamps such as the Bacteo Tower Lamp that I have just purchased? It says they surround and kill 99% of bacteria and viruses. And would they be as good as a Hepa Filter? or should both be used (should the UV lamp be effective)?

We are already equipped with at least three types of oximeters, take vitamin D, and are using and have access to oxygenating equipment or have oxygen available at home.
I found the core temperature changes stimulating the immune system interesting. For centuries folks in the Scandinavian countries and other places have made that a ritual.

Ugw4nlHhISmHP2SE1u54AaABAg,0,vN30emwcNS4,"Could you please provide me with some sources where they state that hours of sleep before midnight are the most important ones?

From my personal experience, it seems it's much more important for me to have a regular sleeping pattern (like I sleep from 1 am - 9 am) than to go to sleep earlier. But I've been hearing that ""story"" since I was a kid - the sleep before midnight is of higher quality. What is so special about midnight? I don't have any light entering my room when I sleep so that's out of the equation. What exactly is affecting me then?

Appreciate these videos! You're doing enormous good for society! I wish you had more views.

So basically what most of us should be doing is:
1. Sleep well (7+ hours) and potentially take melatonin (3-5 mg) 1 hour before sleep if you're having sleep problems
2. Drink vitamin D (especially during the winter season), don't go over 4000 iu/day (consult your doctor if you want to go higher)
3. Vitamin C great antioxidant (just drink some fresh citrus fruit juice every day).

Also, more exoteric stuff:
1. NAC, hyperthermia (sauna is a good way to achieve it), monoclonal antibodies (I doubt everyone will have access to these).

If you get COVID-19 buy a pulse oximeter and track your oxygen levels.",2021-01-17T21:04:57Z,The AI Epiphany,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSEoMpYFsPruCRhEcauI_N0z-rZUEM0JeWcev1S=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Ugwh3SCwORrb4Yey5J94AaABAg,0,vN30emwcNS4,Hello: A further comment on Quercetin:  In another video you discussed a paper which suggests that p-glycoprotein multidrug  transporter could be responsible for reducing the level of Ivermectin to below the 'effective' level of 160 mg/mL .  It is of interest that Quercetin can downregulate p-glycoprotein transporter activity.   It has also been shown that Vitamin D potentiates p-glycoprotein transporter activity.  The FLCCC protocols recommend Quercetin and vitamin D along with Ivermectin and other agents.  Perhaps the role of Quercetin in their recommended treatment is to assist in maintaining the effective level of Ivermectin by modulating the effect of vitamin D on the p-glycoprotein multi-drug transporter.,2021-01-15T01:46:29Z,Edmund Marinelli,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQT5-C7jtpjE-QXz1HcxDyBmtTimyvokzFUGw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgwdJ5BjZVYtD6iIz-54AaABAg,0,vN30emwcNS4,"Thank you for making the most valuable informative video concerning Covid-19 that I have seen. 
I am curious to know what form of vitamin D is mentioned in this video, D3 or D2? Often D3 is much more viable and effective in lower doses than D2. I am guessing that the excessively high levels of vitamin D mentioned are in reference to D2 and the lower levels mentioned are in reference to D3. I personally believe that D2 is inferior to D3 and should be avoided. I am quite fond of Garden Of Life D3 at 5000IU per day coupled with MSM to help with absorption.
One issue that I have is a severe reaction to zinc and melatonin when trying to supplement with either. I am sure that you are unable to tell me why this happens specifically to me, though any indicators of why this might occur in some individuals would be greatly appreciated.",2021-01-15T00:25:58Z,Heather Nissa Ragonese,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTT1Wl1I_bmC6PwjLyizREeKA_5wFFItPeq0GrCPA=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

I didn't wanna wait until one of them hit 90%, so I piled them into the car and took them. I shutter to think what would have happened if I didn't have that little finger monitor, which was $50 bucks at CVS... a small price to pay to have your life spared, if ya ask me!!  You can't even tell the difference between oxygenating at 99%, and 92%... I know, because I've been down with this COVID19 for a month, now. It's just not letting go.

UgxTd1LXkPnidZjd_lV4AaABAg,0,vN30emwcNS4,Hi Thanks for this and all your other videos. On this one in particular and on the use of pulse oximeter  if you have access to one of these how soon after you are infected would you see the oxygen levels dropping? Further how quickly would you see symptoms? Such as loss of smell etc. So one could alone alert rather than having to wait book a test and go through the process before you know you are potentially infected? I ask this because I work in a school and have to go school irrespective of the lockdown. So I would like to be on the watch out! Thanks.,2021-01-10T13:04:43Z,nx u,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTuE9nhF2WJc-LmRsUE1WMoTG2pgR0xWlIiFQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgwAcbfQwyLQKN2sz554AaABAg,0,vN30emwcNS4,"I DID THIS!  Short version: Basically, all on my own, immune deficient, 63 yr old with heart issues, asthma, hx of pneumonia. Could not get tested due to no known positive exposure. So I took zinc (in a throat spray with eucalyptus), Vit C, Vit D, and hyperthermia. After testing positive 6 weeks later, I added NAC, magnesium, melatonin. I also used proning in March when breathing was really difficult:  My grandmother taught me to do that in 1963 when my lungs got congested. 

Was infected March 13, my doctor did not believe it possible for me to have caught it in Maine at the time, and anyway, they had nothing, nothing to offer. So I isolated and used what was on hand: my grandmother's advice to ""sweat it out"" would be impossible because my body would not mount a fever!  BUT in January, I had purchased a cheap flimsy nylon fabric one-person sauna from China (and then let it sit for a month in case it had virus - hey, we knew nothing about it at the time!) - just in case I got sick. So every other day in March, April, May, I turned on the Maine CDC radio update and took a 35 minute sauna. I was finally tested when a nurse heard my horrible-sounding cough over the phone - and yes, after TOTAL isolation, I still tested positive at 6 weeks post onset of symptoms.  Symptoms lasted until Christmas - and still have lung pain. 

But now I can tell my skeptical friends that, yes, MAYBE my cheap little $50 fabric sauna saved my life - just as I thought it did.",2021-01-09T23:55:42Z,Tina Lee,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS1l9nl-7Adh4WzWZ-Zgzu49YqnQqPdYmsD47PDNQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgxRUJ-V3JZDT_S5x-14AaABAg,0,vN30emwcNS4,"For Quercetin why not just eat properly and get lots of it from your diet. It is found in many fruits, vegetables, leaves, seeds, and grains; red onions and kale are common foods containing appreciable amounts of quercetin. 
Similar for NAC; the natural form of it is cysteine and that can be found in beans, lentils, spinach, bananas, salmon and tuna.

There are a number of treatments with water that can increase the body temperature as you mentioned. Some are more complicated than others. The Fever treatment, which is done in a full bath is a serious treatment that requires someone that has the training to administer it. Even so, treatment such as a covered hot foot bath,  a version of the Russian steam bath, and the general revulsive are less complicated in their application, require less equipment as well as much easier, being possible to give such treatment to oneself if needed. thank you so much for sharing all you have!",2021-01-06T13:35:39Z,sarah Oehninger,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSoJQeQKDjM9E_UklAB20tpUnNLWxrHFvwrSjMSfw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgzvFlOhIcsDpvOJOKZ4AaABAg,0,vN30emwcNS4,"Thanks Doctor Seheult for your excellent advice ... If I may share a few tips from a woman who has survived Polio and Post Polio... 
When one person has Covid 19 ... 
keep Everything the infected person uses or touches seperated.
Buy a new Seperate clean plastic 13 gallon trash container with cover with 80 ct roll of 13 gal bags with red ties. Smart and Final has cheap paper goods ... buy a supply just for the infected person of 12 oz hot cups and cold cups 9 oz and 
16 oz also lg supply sturdy paper dinner plates and sturdy plastic heavy duty spoons/forks misc ... straws/ect.... the idea here is simple... by having and keeping the sick ones meals seperate then dispose of paper plates ect into the seperate trash bin in sick room. 
if possible throw out the 13 gallon trash bag with every tissue and all other waste/ from the sick one... Daily .... 
just like in hospital  setting but at home . 
Ideally the sick person has his/her own barhroom to use ... if not have the person use seperate clean towels seperate toothbrush and do not mix laundry... the pillow cases wash daily keep in seperate plastic bag then wash and bleach 
sick person s clothes seperate load. Tears from Covid patients eyes may have Covid virus on the tissues (flush any tissues directly into toilet) or into the seperate trash bin in sick person s room... 
Gold Listerine gargle after meals 
brush teeth then soak cleaned toorhbrush in gold listerine in cup. 
Hand hygiene or hand washing must be done OFTEN as possible! 
keep sanitizer on end table. 

My other tips are drink pure water 
80 0z daily ... make some hot green tea with raw honey/lemon for vitC 
Balsomic vinegar 1/3 cup mix water... 2 tbsps jarred crushed garlic ( add to boiling hot unsalted chicken broth add healthy vegetables like 
baby brussel sprouts carrots baby greenpeas mushrooms ect ) 
WildCaught Atlantic seafood or 
orher healthy Organic proteins
Yellow potato Sweet potato Hummus green salad  Organic Olive Oil... Cornbread black Beans
baked beans Oranges Apples 
Nuts and Seeds and Raisins... 
Real oatmeal Cream of Wheat 
Real cranberry juice ... 
just eat healthy take all the vitamins recommended ... 
Tylenol to help reduce fever read directions limits ...
81 mg low dose aspirin optional
A vaporizor may help with breathing... Vicks vapor rub.... 
I hope these ideas help you get better and not spread to anyone else in your household... 


Also follow Doctor Seheult s advice.",2021-01-06T10:48:17Z,Jackie Costa,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTdFb58NCvSDEKUpedDcLERa6X5JxfNG9fkiw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

December 8, 2020, my father and I got hit with the Covid-19 virus, then on December 14, 2020, symptoms manifested, and Dad was rushed to Temecula Valley Hospital because he had issues breathing.  The paramedics measured his oxygen at 92%, using that tool, that you talked about. 

Anyhow, after two weeks, my father didn't make it. He was able to fight off the virus, but the initial infection started some kind of chain reaction. My Dad's kidneys started to fail, they were operating at 13%, soon the Doctors at TMV, informed us that he may not make it. Truth was... his body began the 'active dying' process. Dad was my best friend, he was father, and I'll miss him.

I live in the tropics and sometimes have to work outside in the sun. It is inevitable that you will break a sweat within minutes of exposure to the tropical sun with ambient temperatures above about 70 ¬∞F and when one moves into the shade, it can take a while to cool down, especially if the ambient temperature is over 90 ¬∞F. I would imagine that during the winter it is far more difficult to elevate body temperatures.

I hearing alot of talk about how vaccinating will increase immunity, but that goes against what i know of the Hoskins effect. as I understand it, once your immune system has seen an antigen, and your B lymphocytes have undergone somatic hypermutation that is the level of immunity you have for life. So if catching covid gives you 60% immunity against future infections, thats what you have for life, immunizing even if the vaccine carrys a 95% immunity will still only boost you back up to 60% so immunization soon after covid is sort of a waste of vaccine is it not? and isnt this why its so important not to catch it in the first place because the vaccine is optimized to provide a superior level of immunity as long as its the first time a body has seen that particular antigen?",2021-01-04T06:20:24Z,The Phoenix Alight,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTCZMxHbTUFMZG9iFgByvKKXiJAoF2J1havCl0_=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

We made ourselves get out of bed, refused to remain lying flat for extended periods.  We could breathe better when we were sitting up. Sometimes the exhaustion was terrible but we made ourselves walk, even if only down our long hallways and back.

FYI for others:
As Dr. Seheult commented, fomite transmission is most likely low. It is spread through droplet nuclei and aerosolization. So....Pulsitile nasal irrigation (IMO) should be a daily routine. Wash your hands...yeah, ok. More importantly, WASH YOUR NOSE (and sinuses, nasopharynx and oropharynx)!! 
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04590365
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded enveloped RNA virus which transmits via droplets, aerosols and direct contact, to reach their target naso- and oropharyngeal epithelial cells through initial electrostatic interactions to cell surface heparan sulphate (HS) proteoglycans. Carrageenan mimics cell surface HS, thereby trapping the virus to allow mucociliary clearance and has demonstrated anti-viral activity in-vitro and in a number of common cold clinical trials when administered as a nasal spray.

UgxbR5lO1d6P3_9690h4AaABAg,0,vN30emwcNS4,"I've reviewed the research, and while not medical advice, I've decided to take the following daily, for the past 2 years now.

1.  Vit D 5000IU
2.  Vit K2(mk-7)  270mcg
3.  Time released magnesium malate

I'd recommend considering these to nearly everyone, unless someone has a high coronary calcium(CC) score, as calcium stabilizes atherosclerosic lesions.   High k2 may remove this calcium, and reducing CC score may increase risk of heart attack or stroke, unless the causes have been addressed the causes of their atherosclerosic load.  One would first need to fix the cause of the lesions, maybe starting low dose k2, then increase later.   Also as was suggested here, care using blood thinners with k2, as high k2 reduces the effect of blood thinners.

I personally also take iodine, because it helps with my hand/foot cold sensitivity.

I'd not take anything else, especially multivitamins, unless discussed with an excellent physician/dietician, well versed and current.",2021-01-03T12:43:34Z,Sanguine,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ75J9XDo8XZGSJ9e2_NzuOsm-rn4ZLWp-tH_89=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

We had a wet sauna cabinet, in which one would sit and be brought up to a sweating temperature. There was a tray of water that would be brought up to boiling temperature inside the cabinet under the seat.

38:52 Re ""portable HEPA filter unit.""  These can be readily fabricated for $40 and can filter 1500+ cubic feet of air per minute, which is often more than an expensive ""HEPA filter.""  

No special skill is required to assemble but two items:  a 20-in. box fan, which costs $20,  and a 20-in. MERV-13 furnace filter which costs  about $20.  Simply use masking tape or any other suitable tape to securely affix the filter on the input side of the fan.  Obviously, two or more of these could be used in a room or throughout a home; could also be used in office settings and many other situations of course.  A single fan is thus capable of theoretically filtering all the air in a good-sized bedroom at least once every 60 seconds.  I think this is critical for slowing the spread in at-home Covid settings.

A MERV-13 filter will capture up to 75 percent of particles 0.3 to 1.0 microns in size.  A MERV-16 filter will capture at least 95 percent of such sized particles.  Thus, either is capable of capturing SARS-Cov-2 and other viruses and bacteria, although I believe some SARS Cov-2 virons may be as small as 0.1 microns -??  These filters will also capture lead dust, smoke,  and other toxins.  Note that there are two other rating systems for filters, Home Depot (MPR) and 3M (FPR) have their own, but there are comparison charts online.  

Also, if one has a forced air heating and/or cooling system, more efficient filters should be utilized as well in the furnace or a/c unit as air is circulated throughout the entire living space (note that there will be more air flow resistance with more efficient filters, check maximum efficiency stated by the manufacturer).  More information about filters, fan air flow rates, virus and bacteria sizes, etc. can be gleaned from the internet for those interested.",2021-01-03T02:32:27Z,rla1000,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQTaMy0leu9Zh1XPypnQdDRpwlmX2wEYirQDw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj
Ugy_Wokqtfq2ffHTrDZ4AaABAg,0,vN30emwcNS4,"This is very interesting! Thank you for posting.

I have a question: about the innate/adaptive immune system & Vitamins C & D...

So the innate immune system gets weaker with age, and adaptive immune system includes those T-cells, which cannot be activated without Vitamin D... so which type of the immune T-cells need Vitamin D & which immune cells use Vitamin C?

There was a study deep in Africa, where there's a lot of sunshine (--> Vitamin D) all the time... and there were very few cases of Covid... but it had the highest rate of flu... also we've heard about the Spanish Flu in 1918 mostly attacked the younger ones...

So my question would be: is there any kind of correlation whether Vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in Covid-19 and that causes dysfunctional T-cells? And what are the immune cells that need and use Vitamin C the most? And are those more prevalent in the common cold or flu?

Any correlation along those lines as described above?

One point not stressed when discussing hyperthermia was the simple step of NOT taking medicine to reduce your fever. Fever is generally good during infection to rev up immune function and to decrease viral replication. Most Europeans and Americans are so used to taking fever reducers at first sign of fever that it may be blunting our immune systems. Maybe that's one reason the advanced countries seem to have more severe disease and deaths than poorer countries. We all take tylenol,advil,aspirin out of habit. Stay safe doc.

A company in US found that a specific mouthwash swilled/gargled/spat out helps to mute the viral load. Makes sense when we know loss of smell and taste is a feature. The company with this product is currently modifying and testing the modified mouthwash. I googled it but I only heard the word and of course cd not find it. No surprise. As a child, with a cold virus, mum made us gargle with salted water over and over. With the mouthwash mentioned above, the advantage is the 'aerosol' effect as one is gargling, is that it is being breathed in, also helping to reduce viral load.

If we are directly exposed to covid 19 and we do not develop the disease will we produce antibodies?

Maybe you¬¥ve allready done the video, or else this might be something to work on in an  upcoming video.

Q: So i¬¥ve got The Covid. But now i feel great. When do i break isolation? When do i get back to work? 

I have friends that been sick feeling fine after two days. But others that feel sick on and off for a few months.

 A colleague at work was ill during christmas and now wants to comeback to work. Over here in Sweden it¬¥s ok to go back to work if you¬¥re feeling fine 48 hrs after last sign of sickness.
