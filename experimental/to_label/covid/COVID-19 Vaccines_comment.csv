UgwMnFGnulVGuiXPfrB4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"You make a good lecturer in the university. Very clear presentation.The Az vaccine is made up of a harmless monkey virus with the covid DNA virus. Much like harmless virus used in traditional vaccines  These vaccines made up of virus (harmless) goes into the bloodstream gets attacked by our immune system straight away to boost the immune system. Some may manage to invade our cells but they too will be destroyed by our immune system ultimately boosting our immune system.But the Pfizer and Moderna ""vaccine"" is made up if made up of mRNA encased in lipid molecule.They will not be attacked by our immune system once injected into our bloodstream and they enter every kind of cells they encounter. Once in our cells, the mRNA uses ribosomes to produce covid spike proteins which induces our immune system to produce antibodies against the covid virus.But the worrying pertinent point I want to highlight is these healthy cells invaded by mRNA will later be destroyed by our immune system. These cells.could be kidney, heart, brain, reproductive cell etc...If the dose is heavy it kills. So the dosage is highly critical. I dont think the big Pharma want us to know.

I'm wondering if there is another receptor in more advanced level of immunology, that the Tcell would connect to, to communicate to the  APC to tell it to self destruct, and if something in the vaccine is causing that receptor to NOT open up to the signal from the Tcell, so as to not be destroyed during the mRNA ""priming"" process. If that is the case, then I find that interesting and also wonder if something can cause that prevention, to say, accidentally stay in place? Because should that same cell, get the real infection that got passed the antibodies, and the Tcell is not able to tell it to destroy itself in order to prevent proliferation?

I have sooo many questions... not going to list them all here at this time though, but I am using them to guide my research as well as possible.

To the best of my knowledge, Tcells don't themselves actually do the killing - they signal the APC to kill itself. But I would love someone to correct me on that.

Also, I got from another video, that when an APC is creating the protein spikes, they use two methods of presenting peptides of the spike; one by presenting them as MHC1 or MHC2 depending on the APC type (immune system cell or non immune system cell), and also sending out the peptide parts on their own, for other APC cells to acquire. 

Basically, I hear different explanations from different sources, all seeming to have credentials behind them, Professor Zack Murphy included. At this point, some of the shorter videos just aren't in-depth enough for me anymore, and some of course are more advanced, which is exactly what I'm wanting.

Which tells me, JUST like media sources, you have to go to different sources, to piece together the bigger picture of what is really going on, all the while studying it for yourself from literature. I'm currently working my way through Janeway's Immuno Biology.

Therefore those whose Thymus gland is inactive, older people, have a much lesser period of immunity efficiency.
~ Which is also why the younger the person the less dosage of vaccine is administered. Because they have a stronger immunity response to the same amount of vaccine than older people.",2021-11-30T02:50:26Z,DIOMEDES ABCMNXYZ,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQlwt8ktdi42ftV-0HOEjBZESQerSseoOtTeg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

1. since the antibodies produced by plasma cells are secreted into the plasma, the viruses neutralized by the antibodies (at time 19:01) are however only those that are not yet intracellular, right?
2. being Covid, as it seems, a systemic infection, if the viruses infect a nervous district, the cytokines produced after the priming induced by the vaccine via CD8 (at time 20:17) can destroy that district, following the logic explained in the video. In this way the virus would be eliminated, yes, but also the district would be eliminated. And it would not be a great result. As if to say: to cure cavities, I'll take out your tooth. Where am I wrong?

UgwGtyk_pnZUP3PYVmd4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"There Is No Shortage of Energy; There Is Shortage of Normalcy

Despite increased production of energy from renewable sources, and despite the slowdown in car manufacturing, oil prices are skyrocketing. Even though fewer power plants still burn coal, coal prices are skyrocketing, as well. Natural gas prices, too, are going through the roof, and energy demand seems to outpace supply in every country and in every form of energy. Have Earth‚Äôs energy sources dwindled so drastically in a matter of months? The answer is a resounding ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù There is no shortage of energy; there is a serious shortage of normalcy in human relations. I hope the current crisis will put some sense into humanity‚Äôs insane consumption.
The energy crunch indicates that we are over consuming. We are producing too much, throwing the excess production to the trash, polluting the ground, the air, and the water, and then we are complaining that we do not have enough. It is about as sane as killing one‚Äôs parents and then pleading for the court‚Äôs mercy because I‚Äôve recently been orphaned.
It is time we reconsider everything we produce‚Äîhow we divide production, profits, and goods, which services are necessary and which are redundant, and most importantly, how we treat one another. The goal of this process should be clear to everyone: survival.
There is no ulterior motive, no attempt to dominate or deprive anyone of power or wealth. It is simply that reality is forcing us to take all of humanity and the entire planet into consideration. If we don‚Äôt, our entire civilization will collapse like a deck of cards.
Since we still do not understand it and insist on running things the way we have always been running them‚Äîthrough power games‚ÄîI anticipate a very cold and gloomy winter for the northern hemisphere. The energy crunch will leave many in dark and cold houses; there will be no gas for cars, and renewable energy will not replace traditional sources since there will be little sun during the winter. I hope that at least, it will make us rethink our values. If it doesn‚Äôt, next summer will be even worse than the awful summer that just ended.
I know that many people are counting on the promise of renewable energy to solve the energy problems of humanity. I think they are mistaken. There is plenty of energy, far more than we really need. We could cut emissions by at least half tomorrow. But the more we have, the hungrier we become, so our thirst for energy will never be satiated, and we will never stop exploiting the planet or each other until we reeducate ourselves and start being humane toward each other.
We have been behaving like spoiled brats whose parents buy them whatever they want. Now, our parents have run out of money and our childhood is over. It is time for us to mature and conduct ourselves like responsible adults, caring for all of humanity the way a mother cares for her entire family. If we think like a family, we will achieve normalcy.",2021-10-27T16:25:15Z,Liora Baranes,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRqiE08ZR43ywfHUz4KfLQSoy32pkQsjDmH=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Ugw7bwePMcM1DgVXtah4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"Translation of the UN‚Äôs ‚Äú2030 Agenda blueprint for globalist government‚Äù (controlled by corporate interests)

Goal 1) End poverty in all its forms everywhere. Translation: Put everyone on government welfare, food stamps, housing subsidies and handouts that make them obedient slaves to global government. Never allow people upward mobility to help themselves. Instead, teach mass victimization and obedience to a government that provides monthly ‚Äúallowance‚Äù money for basic essentials like food and medicine. Label it ‚Äúending poverty.‚Äù

Goal 2) End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Translation: Invade the entire planet with GMOs and Monsanto‚Äôs patented seeds while increasing the use of deadly herbicides under the false claim of ‚Äúincreased output‚Äù of food crops. Engineer genetically modified plants to boost specific vitamin chemicals while having no idea of the long-term consequences of genetic pollution or cross-species genetic experiments carried out openly in a fragile ecosystem.

Goal 3) Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all of all ages
Translation: Mandate 100+ vaccines for all children and adults at gunpoint, threatening parents with arrest and imprisonment if they refuse to cooperate. Push heavy medication use on children and teens while rolling out ‚Äúscreening‚Äù programs. Call mass medication ‚Äúprevention‚Äù programs and claim they improve the health of citizens.

Goal 4) Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Translation: Push a false history and a dumbed-down education under ‚ÄúCommon Core‚Äù education standards that produce obedient workers rather than independent thinkers. Never let people learn real history, or else they might realize they don‚Äôt want to repeat it.

Goal 5) Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
Translation: Criminalize Christianity, marginalize heterosexuality, demonize males and promote the LGBT agenda everywhere. The real goal is never ‚Äúequality‚Äù but rather the marginalization and shaming of anyone who expresses any male characteristics whatsoever. The ultimate goal is to feminize society, creating widespread acceptance of ‚Äúgentle obedience‚Äù along with the self-weakening ideas of communal property and ‚Äúsharing‚Äù everything. Because only male energy has the strength to rise up against oppression and fight for human rights, the suppression of male energy is key to keeping the population in a state of eternal acquiescence.

Goal 6) Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all 
Translation: Allow powerful corporations to seize control of the world‚Äôs water supplies and charge monopoly prices to ‚Äúbuild new water delivery infrastructure‚Äù that ‚Äúensures availability.‚Äù

Goal 7) Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
Translation: Penalize coal, gas and oil while pushing doomed-to-fail ‚Äúgreen‚Äù energy subsidies to brain-dead startups headed by friends of the White House who all go bankrupt in five years or less.
The green startups make for impressive speeches and media coverage, but because these companies are led by corrupt idiots rather than capable entrepreneurs, they always go broke. (And the media hopes you don‚Äôt remember all the fanfare surrounding their original launch.)

Goal 8) Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.
Translation: Regulate small businesses out of existence with government-mandated minimum wages that bankrupt entire sectors of the economy. Force employers to meet hiring quotas of LGBT workers while mandating wage tiers under a centrally planned work economy dictated by the government. Destroy free-market economics and deny permits and licenses to those companies that don‚Äôt obey government dictates.

Goal 9) Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.
Translation: Put nations into extreme debt with the World Bank, spending debt money to hire corrupt American corporations to build large-scale infrastructure projects that trap developing nations in an endless spiral of debt. See the book Confessions of an Economic Hit Man by John Perkins to understand the details of how this scheme has been repeated countless times over the last several decades.

Goal 10) Reduce inequality within and among countries
Translation: Punish the rich, the entrepreneurs and the innovators, confiscating nearly all gains by those who choose to work and excel. Redistribute the confiscated wealth to the masses of non-working human parasites that feed off a productive economy while contributing nothing to it‚Ä¶ all while screaming about ‚Äúequality!‚Äù

Goal 11) Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
Translation: Ban all gun ownership by private citizens, concentrating guns into the hands of obedient government enforcers who rule over an unarmed, enslaved class of impoverished workers. Criminalize living in most rural areas by instituting Hunger Games-style ‚Äúprotected areas‚Äù which the government will claim are owned by ‚Äúthe People‚Äù even though no people are allowed to live there. Force all humans into densely packed, tightly controlled cities where they are under 24/7 surveillance and subject to easy manipulation by the government.

Goal 12) Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
Translation: Begin levying punitive taxes on the consumption of fossil fuels and electricity, forcing people to live under conditions of worsening standards of living that increasingly resemble Third World conditions.
Use social influence campaigns in TV, movies and social media to shame people who use gasoline, water or electricity, establishing a social construct of ninnies and tattlers who rat out their neighbours in exchange for food credit rewards.

Goal 13) Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
Translation: Set energy consumption quotas on each human being and start punishing or even criminalizing ‚Äúlifestyle decisions‚Äù that exceed energy usage limits set by governments. Institute total surveillance of individuals in order to track and calculate their energy consumption. Penalize private vehicle ownership and force the masses onto public transit, where TSA grunts and facial recognition cameras can monitor and record the movement of every person in society as a scene ripped right out of Minority Report.

Goal 14) Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development
Translation: Ban most ocean fishing, plunging the food supply into an extreme shortage and causing runaway food price inflation that puts even more people into economic desperation. Criminalize the operation of private fishing vessels and place all ocean fishing operations under the control of government central planning. Only allow favoured corporations to conduct ocean fishing operations (and make this decision based entirely on which corporations give the most campaign contributions to corrupt lawmakers).

Goal 15) Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
Translation: Roll out Agenda 21 and force humans off the land and into controlled cities. Criminalize private land ownership, including ranches and agricultural tracts.

Tightly control all agriculture through a corporate-corrupted government bureaucracy whose policies are determined almost entirely by Monsanto while being rubber-stamped by the USDA.

Ban woodstoves, rainwater collection and home gardening in order to criminalize self-reliance and force total dependence on the government.

Goal 16) Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
Translation: Grant legal immunity to illegal aliens and ‚Äúprotected‚Äù minority groups, which will be free to engage in any illegal activity ‚Äî including openly calling for the mass murder of police officers ‚Äî because they are the new protected class in society. ‚ÄúInclusive institutions‚Äù means granting favourable tax structures and government grants to corporations that hire LGBT workers or whatever groups are currently in favour with the central planners in government. Use the IRS and other federal agencies to selectively punish unfavourable groups with punitive audits and regulatory harassment, all while ignoring the criminal activities of favoured corporations that are friends of the political elite.

Goal 17) Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development
Translation: Enact global trade mandates that override national laws while granting unrestricted imperialism powers to companies like Monsanto, Dow Chemical, RJ Reynolds, Coca-Cola and Merck. Pass global trade pacts that bypass a nation‚Äôs lawmakers and override intellectual property laws to make sure the world‚Äôs most powerful corporations maintain total monopolies over drugs, seeds, chemicals and technology. Nullify national laws and demand total global obedience to trade agreements authored by powerful corporations and rubber-stamped by the UN.

Total enslavement of the planet by 2030

Ugzr7bfsOByfrRofVjZ4AaABAg.9S1KWJNmVcR9SKGrq6oWfO,Ugzr7bfsOByfrRofVjZ4AaABAg,35Idb_lCU4o,"@IgA ¬†So, you haven't provided any refutations of my statements at all. From what I can see, that is in regard to everything you've responded with so far, all you have offered are unsubstantiated claims of disagreement, and essentially an appeal to your own authority which you haven't verified (and which wouldn't even make you an authority because of the area you referred to). You've offered personal anecdote, with no substantiated numbers, Just unsupported claims of photos. I don't know what photos would provide here aside from evidence of irrelevant anecdote. And ironically you've provided insults toward me, while challenging me not to respond with ad hom, when I've done nothing of the sort up to this point. 

1. It's ironic that you are telling me that I don't know how science works, when instead of providing the data collected to acquire a proper inference from all of the numbers, you appeal to your own personal work, which is a small sample size and not sufficient to reasonably represent the total population. That's not how science is done. Saying, ""You have no idea how many I have seen"" (whatever number that is meant to imply) in no way substantiates the claim that the vaccine is a worse choice over the consequences of getting the virus while unvaccinated. Your reasoning is so flawed here it's impressive. So, you didn't give any numbers, you only appealed to a small sample size that you would have personally encountered, and none of that negates the accumulation of total data representing the entire population. Also, your claim is really suspicious, being that it wouldn't be a breach of confidentiality to give general numbers. You wouldn't be giving up any individual patient's personal information about anything they are personally experiencing. This would not be a HIPPA violation. If that was the case, no hospital could report the general statistics from their institutions, which they do every day.

Take note, I didn't say there was absolutely no risk, I was very clear to say that there was a lot less risk by taking the vaccine, then there was from getting the virus while unvaccinated. 

2. You accuse me of using ""concrete language"" for the vaccine, when I'm referring to the total data provided, and the inferences acquired from that data. What ""concrete language"" do you have a problem with?

3. You merely offered a claim that you would ""spend all day"" dismantling my ""paradoxical weasel-concrete worded claims"", but you have done nothing to even begin dismantling anything. All you are doing is self-aggrandizing at this point. You don't need to spend ""all day"" on this, if what I'm doing is as egregious as you're trying to hyperbolically imply, it shouldn't take you much time to provide a very simple refutation. What is ""paradoxical"" about anything I have said? And here you are using the term ""weasel"", when you're ironically telling me not to provide ad hom, which I haven't done at all up to this point.

4. You then, after providing nothing of substance, advise me to not get my information ""from Google"". Do you think scientific journal entries are not available through a Google scholarly article search? Do you really think I can't access journal entries on the internet? This whole ""don't get your information from Google"" approach just highlights, with extreme clarity, your ignorance. No one is getting information ""from Google"", Google is a search engine that can be utilized to access information from reputable sources, like scientific journals. You can search, using Google's scholarly article search tool, and that will provide you with various scholarly articles which are sourced from the publication websites. These are not from Google. You are showing that you do not know what you're talking about.

5. For you to end all of this by claiming that wearing a mask is pointless, even further displays your arrogance and ignorance. And that's not ad hom; I'll explain why it's not. It's arrogance, because you are claiming, yet again something in opposition, but you are not providing any substantiation for your claims, you're merely hoping that your unsupported assertions about working in radiology departments (in some capacity) will make you seem authoritative on this matter. It's also showing ignorance, because the vast majority of research and data provided on masks, demonstrates that masks are effective at limiting spread of airborne moisture particles, which carry the virus. This isn't just intuitive, the data clearly demonstrates this. You were the one who said you were going to refute my claims, so you have a burden of proof to substantiate this alleged refutation, which you have not done.

And I don't know how I can contact you ""directly"" (aside from doing that here, which I don't see a problem with), as you didn't provide any contact information. I also don't know why you'd be reluctant to continue the conversation here, resorting to wanting your ""very useful"" information to be private. Why would you want to hide your valuable information from anyone on this forum?

In conclusion, you have done nothing here but attempt to build yourself up as some authority, all upon baseless claims, and with regard to working in radiology departments, which doesn't make you an expert on virology nor epidemiology. You also made claims about how what I said is paradoxical, but in no way even began to explain how it is so. You've made baseless claims about an undisclosed number of patients you've observed experiencing negative side effects from the vaccine, which in no way offers a reasonable inference about the general population, especially in light of large amounts of data which represent the total population far greater than your little personal sample size (whatever that is), demonstrating that it is much better to get the vaccine, all risks considered, then it is to experience the virus unvaccinated, all risks considered. All this data is easily accessible either through CDC links, or searching through Google scholarly articles results, which come from the journals themselves, as you are reading them on the journals when you go to the journal websites. And unless you want to allege some sort of worldwide scientific community conspiracy, then you've got nothing of significance on your side here (not that a conspiracy theory would be significant). None of this is a refutation of anything I've said. This is all just an attempt to baselessly build yourself up as some authority, using rhetorical tactics. Your entire offering can be boiled down to: ""I've seen things personally. Trust me. I work in radiology (so not an expert in this area anyway). You are wrong. I am right. Also, more unsubstantiated claims about things realted to this. Peace out.""

I expected some great challenge, and you've provided nothing of significance. It might have been better for you if you hadn't responded at all.",2021-09-15T20:29:05Z,Cloud Of Time,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTElsAaKstMPg6LZxb_dKdAaz-nAMC7EcfxXGzm=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

It's like talking for nearly the whole time about a brand new car, unlike any previous car and how it is supposed to work, but is really at the crash test dummy stage of development. So do we have any independent data on how it is performing in these crash tests? In the video Ninja Nerd says ""what the company data, interim analysis, press releases show"" and then spends less than a minute on the topic, which may be understandable as why would the for profit pharma companies want to scare us or even raise any concerns that might impact their sales. 

Why should we trust this company provided data and PR/marketing spin on safety? It's like saying should we should trust a used car salesman. No we wouldn't. We'd get an independent mechanic to check a used car rather than take the used car salesman's word on it.

Questions I would ask my ""independent mechanic"" to investigate would include: Where are the independent studies on safety and side effects? How are side effects being monitored and how comprehensive is this monitoring? How might these vaxxs interact with other vaxxs and medications or is there any data on this? Are certain subsets of people more likely of have immediate adverse reactions and side effects?",2021-08-11T12:23:41Z,Peter R,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTbyG0SU2BxcDtFGwl80dar2BNPapci0Vrb=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgzsQC6uiJI2f6tYAER4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"Hi Ninja Nerds, your videos are great! I read something interesting recently that I want to share with you. Covid-19 has a replication enzyme, a protease class, bit like our digestion system uses a protease enzyme for digesting proteins from our meals). This replication enzyme is also needed for Covid-19 to break out of the host cell. Else, after a succesful replication, the host cell becomes a jail and the virus is trapped. We all know the protein spikes of covid-19 can mutate and evade our immune system. So vaccines attack the virus at its strongest most addaptive side. It can how ever not mutate its replication enzyme if it wants to be succesful. If that enzyme doesnt stay a protease its End game for the virus. So medication that attacks the replication&outbreak enzyme from Covid-19 would be a more efficient way to deal with it. For example, you never would have to worry about mutations again! Pfizer and several other pharma companies are developing such enzyme blockers. Pfizer even states on its official site that the ic version is ready and probably end of the year also the oral version. A lot of virusses that mutate fast like, Influenza, West Nile, Denque, Herpes, Hiv and lots and lots more also use a protease enzyme for replication! So the future of pandemic virusses could be fat soluble protease enzyme blockers. As you get rid then of all mutations at once. 

It is like in general even experts do not realize yet how universal this could be as a medicine against virusses that mutate so fast. 

If you look at research databases there are a lot of plant molecules that dock and inhibit the protease enzyme from covid-19 and many other virusses at the same time. So broad spectrum inhibiting protease enzyme blockers.
If nature can do that, pharmaceutical companies should be able to accomplish that also I think. 

*Imagine, to never have to fear pandemics, as all fast mutative virusses have protease enzymes as their Achilles heel*

(only fat soluble protease enzyme blockers would work btw as water soluble ones wont be able to get inside the cell)

I have a question: What stops the Cytotoxic T-cells from destroying the host cell that is processing the vaccine? What is the difference between a cell processing the vaccine and a cell actually infected with the virus?",2021-07-02T01:46:12Z,Alisa Yuldybaeva,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQUO0K94NB60DAN3LH7FA8K2ny36V9lZdbamOOVj8k=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj
UgwseDTx0q8YyxDWmdp4AaABAg.9PH8jtgJcKD9PS6Dan5tEg,UgwseDTx0q8YyxDWmdp4AaABAg,35Idb_lCU4o,"Hey! I saw your question, but to answer them the second question needs to be answered first. 

So when it comes to the difference between the two of them you have to look at the form each pathogen comes in. Whether it‚Äôs a live/active version of it or a dead/inactive version of it is something that we have to take note of. This is important because this determines whether or not a microorganism will be able to cause an infection within the cells of the human body. In the case of inactive forms of pathogens, no infection can occur because they simply cannot do anything. Because of the fact that they were genetically modified to be that way, infections which causes replication of viruses to occur, cannot take place. 

Now in the event that a cell does become infected with the virus, the infected cells will send out chemical signals, known as interferons, that not only stimulates them but nearby cells as well to produce proteins that prevent the virus from replicating within them. By doing this, it also helps restrict the spread of the virus before an adaptive immune response takes place. During this time, if there is no existing memory of an infection similar to this, the body sends the white blood cells along with the B lymphocytes (memory cells) to fight against the infection. Once the infection disappears, these memory B cells will then be stimulated to multiply without having to differentiate into plasma cells to provide our immune system a long-lasting memory against a particular disease. 

Now, to sum these things up and to answer your questions, a cell processing the vaccine is considered as a dead/inactive (even weakened) form of a virus. Because of that it is not enough to cause an infection which can stimulate the cells to release interferons and signals to the adaptive immune response. However, a live/active one is more than capable to doing that. As for what stops T-cells from destroying the cell membrane that is processing the vaccine is again because of the fact that the virus form that is being used in that vaccine one that is a weakened, dead/inactivated version of it.

UgxjNhDOEfF1tAp8O-N4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"Our immunity works perfectly fine without vaccines, as long as they are healthy.  No vaccine has been rpoven safe or effective, for over 30 years.  This is why Del BigTree and Robert Kennedy jr. won a landmark case against the government who gave immuntiy thru Reagan and their protocol of their immunity being they must test for safety and efficacy....which if you ever read the manufacturer's inserts, it says in a black box warning 'This vaccine has not been tested for safety or efficacy.  You may get the disease you are being innoculated for.' Why do we need a 'gene therapy' for a infection that has a 99% survival rate, and this 'vaccine' is experimental...so to all those who say they have done their research and go get this:  YOU ARE THE RESEARCH.  If even ONE person dies from this experiment, or is harmed, does that not matter when if they actually got the virus they would be building natural immunity to it.  There is no way to vaccinate against a RNA, corona virus flu as you may know it mutates with each person that gets it.  Microbiologists have tested 1500 positive convid tests, and they found only seasonal flu A and B. They contacted the CDC to get the RNA protocols of this convid, and they didn't have it, which means they have not even isolated this virus.  What we have here is a giant experiment on the public and telling them that this will prevent it or even just make symptoms less harmful is not even proven nor can they...now they just tell everyone there are variants...DUH, every year the flu variants go  around due to the fact they mutate with each person.   Did they ever tell the public, that you may get BELLS PALSY?  Or you could die?  A Phizer scientist who use to work there says this is a dangerous gene therapy, not a vaccine which triggers the lymphnodes and causes a antibody production...this mRNA is getting the cells, this will cause many to go into sepsis when exposed to the wild virus, because that spike protein is in all the cells and getting into the bloodstream causing blood clotting and heart attacks.  I would not want to be an experiment.  I do appreciate your explanation of this but call it what it is...IT""S GENE THERAPY...not a vaccine...even the Phizer scientist said this.  Even Elon Musk says that with mRNA you can become a butterfly as this is a synthetic programable 'software system' and technology and he thinks it's a miracle...I say it's mad scientists trying to play gods and ruining our body's own immunity.  Real science goes for the cause and cure, not chemicals or biomagnetic thecnology or cutting out things to deal with symptoms.

Also wondering if anyone was introduced to a sick person after receiving the vaccine to prove its effectiveness?  Had a brother who died from an FDA approved medication called AZT to treat AIDS.  Also wondering if the body can react to this like it does with antibiotics and make a superbug or what the long term effect is on the immune response system once altered.

How does the immune system know the difference between a virus infected cell's protein fragments and the vaccinated  Cell's spike protein fragments?

However, we would be very nieve to believe the trials are not set to bias and champion the success of this relatively new technology, history and legal cases suggests this.

Many tests that usually need to be done were allowed to be missed in these trials to excellerate the process, can we agree on this. 

What does annoy me is that you keep mentioning these as vaccines, however, none of these are vaccine by definition, it's very clear that this is gene therapy, the tech was always referred to as such, a clear deception by the pharmaceutical marketing departments, and something they employ often. It like calling side effects to vaccines, 'an immune response, it sounds better doesnt it, vaccines and immune response, as opposed to never before used in humans trials rna/mrna gene therapy and side effects.

It's also concerning that in this video you mention only relative risk reduction not absolute risk reduction from 95% efficacy to ?, science has never hidden behind numbers as much as they have with these gene therapies.

Regarding the safety profiles, as we stand today, there have been more adverse events reported from these gene therapies in 6 months, than in 30 years of real vaccines (70) combined. Maybe we need to think again? If this were a vaccine, this experiment on the public would be forced to stop TODAY, why hasn't it?

In future and if you look a patents, you can see that we'll be vaccinating people with DNA, RNA vaccines from everything from hayfever, coronaviruses, flu and cancer, WITHOUT the usual safety we would expect from a real vaccine or medications. 

Of course all will be clear when you realise just how much has been invested in this technology, hence the reason why our governments and big pharma including anyone on YouTube or on social media are being forced to keep there mouths shut and are even able to discusses available treatments that show far more promise and could have really saved millions across the world already. Dare I mention Ivermectin.

If you take away the sketchy safety profile of all gene therapies available, we could potentially be increasing an immunity escape, we're giving gene therapy that is genetically coded for the s protein from wuhan original sarscov2 virus code, the gene therapies will absolutely need to be updated as the virus mutates in future, but what damages have we already done towards excellerating the virus escaping our immunity, especially given that we are vaccinating during a pandemic with earlier rna and narrow instructions by targeting the s protein.

Its not quite the same virus now than a year ago, this could be dangerous.

These vaccines could create a more rapid immune escape and be far more dangerous to us all. Sarscovid2 certainly seems to be getting more transmissable doesnt it, and in a short space of time given how slowly coronaviruses usually change.

The jury is out on these gene therapies and I can't help thinking that although this technology shows lots of promise, we are not ready to play around with the immune system of the worlds population just yet, the gene therapy  may work well on covid19, but considering other data, we have sacrificed many lives waiting for this experimental gene therapy to come about, and if we haven't got this right, and science without vested interest in these gene therapies are NOT heard, we could be missing the potential of curing so many things with this technology like cancer, however, if further problems continue and we are not being open and honest in the media, we may set back this technology many decades.",2021-06-18T12:24:29Z,YouTubeIsDying,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS2OWWBAG32MwxugflUtIeKFYp6IPsOs__rh8tK_IvwECtvN8aZa0v5fNvzu2Sr=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgxYJueUNmivU3dMOf94AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"*Conspiracy Theory*

1. The Gandhi family started backing Pflzer openly along with its associates in social media.

2. A news float in Social Media that there would be third wave which will put children‚Äôs at risk

3. In two weeks, CDC, Center of Disease Control under Biden approves vaccination of kids from May 13, 2021

4. As soon as CDC approves, Pfizer roll out vaccination for kids the very next day all over US.

5. No trial data is ever shared in public. No one knows when, how and where it was developed

6. India has appox 40Cr children under 18 years. With Rs 3000 Pflzer per kid, the minimum business for Pflzer is appox 120000+ Cr. If a conservative 20% commission is taken for the family, it is Rs 24000 Cr.

7. GOI refused Pflzer vaccine and put 2 key conditions for permission. First is no immunity with law and second local trials.

8. Suddenly posters in India popped up, says ‚ÄúModi why you shipped our children vaccine overseas‚Äù. While there is no kids vaccine yet developed in India.

9. Immediately Bharat Biotech applies for Phase II and III trial of Kids vaccine.

10. Immediately a PIL is filed in court to stop Bharat Biotech to stop trial for kids vaccine.

11. Like 2nd wave which started from Maharashtra, another congress state Rajasthan reports kids infected.

12. Although, as per Dr KK Agarwal video, kids are not to worry as they have best immune system and just need to be treated for symptoms. They will be fine with their Anti Bodies

13. Dr KK Agarwal dies of Corona.

14. US Admin report that it has huge surplus of Pfizer vaccine.

15. Delhi Govt. Dy CM ask GOI to talk to Moderna and Pflzer for vaccine  import.

16. Moderna and Pflzer refuse to supply vaccine to Indian statesa and said that they will deal only with government of India

17. So the ownership is now on GOI. Effort is to put pressure on GOI to allow Pflzer without trials and with legal immunity. Tomorrow if anything goes wrong with Pflzer which will happen encouraged by opposition parties, Pflzer is legally protected and the blame will be put on GOI.

18. So by refusing to supply to states, Pflzer lobby very smartly made GOI responsible for everything. 
Why Pfizer want legal immunity in India? and why Modi govt made it a mandatory condition along with trial?

This is the answer

In a shocking new report on the KOVID-19 vaccines, it has been discovered that the Pflzer coronavirus vaccine may have long term health effects not previously disclosed, including ‚ÄúALS, Alzheimer‚Äôs, and other neurological degenerative diseases.‚Äù

In a latest paper the Pflzer vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients. Prion-based diseases are, according to the CDC, a form of neurodegenerative diseases, meaning that the Pflzer vaccine is potentially likely to cause long term damage and negative health effects with regards to the brain.

We Indians are not PIGS anymore and The Modi government is saving our lives.

19. Pflzer has direct relationship with Lab in china and Chinese lab run with US funding.

20. Another Dr KK Agarwal video advocated for basic Ayurveda treatment. Ayurveda treatment means straight massive loss to Pharma Lobby including Hospitals. Hence Ramdev controversy started out of no where.

22. Shahid Jameel, the chairman of Genom sequencing lab, the one who was kicked out by Modi Govt and other 800 doctors around the world wrote to GOI to give the access to medical data of covid patients. why?

All developed countries are spending millions of dollars to protect the medical data. They are working round the clock to prevent the reverse AI applications to gain any access to the medical data of the country. why?

Because, in bio-war medical data is vital to customize the virus according to the country.

Bisen administration has given access to Huwai to US data.

Now connect all dots and the picture which emerge is a criminal nexus of the Family, Its parasites in various government and media with Global Pharma Lobby lead by Pflzer.

This is the story and let this sink in. A faction of Govt. is continuously working to understand the moves of our enemies and counter them with our own counter moves.

Covaxin is the biggest surprise to our enemies. So will be its use on children. 

2DG will be another surprise and a big hurdle in the planl of our adversaries.

We are in the middle of Bio War and we have to win.

What drives me .. At 36'': why should we take a vaccine (AstraZeneca) .. that's goal is based on a (questionable) PCR-test that shows a fragment of anything .. To MAKE people ill .. even if NO symptoms? That's kind of absurd but yes, it's interlocking with Macron's word of: ""nous sommes en guerre"". The enemy IN my body IS there because a PCR-test will show! Don't you no longer RELY on signs your body shows .. If PCR tells you - you're sick and a danger for all the people around you.

What are we doing here testing out new technologies? Putting our fingers in the very natural process of SELECTION and Co-Existing with Viruses since thousands of years .. in order to get a balanced situation as PART OF the nature, the equilibrium. With all consequences - with the option to die e.g. That's life. Now we're manipulating natural processes for the sake of - what? We all know: there IS a virus or even a spectrum of .. but there's NO pandemic situation for our ""civilized community"". Isn't it?

Talking about ""pandemics"" .. gives the opportunity to conduct the biggest field test ever at the biggest scale imaginable to check biodefense-strategies. THAT's the goal - assuming that in the near future the worse is yet to come: mutants, diversity .. Take the vaccine to be prepared .. be part of the Arche Noah. To be prepared for our war.

UgzTLjsaJmV_aD-a7Rd4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"I have four comments pertaining to the presentation of trial methods and results in this video:

1) For the methods explanation, it would be helpful to know the indications provided to the study participants upon receiving the placebo or vaccine itself to control for impact of environmental exposure to the virus (i.e., How do we know the control group was not any more exposed to the virus after placebo receipt than the trial group?). This may explain some of the differences in efficacy by country despite lower dose (e.g., ASTRAZENECA Brazil versus UK arms).

2) It would be helpful to know the number of participants that went onto the placebo versus trial group. Comparison of participants infected would be more fair if presented as proportions, rather than total numbers. 

3) If we take the example of MODERNA data, the rate of severe symptom occurrence upon infection seems to be about 0.16% (30/185) for placebo and less than 0% (>0/11) for the vaccine group. For Pfizer, we are looking at about 0.06% (9/162) control versus 0.13% (1/9) vaccine group. Overall, the evidence presented to support the efficacy of vaccines against the severity of the disease is low due to small number of participants infected upon vaccination acting as an important denominator in the calculation.

4) For ASTRAZENCA, how does the 131 positive cases of infection break-down by control versus trial arms?",2021-05-03T23:49:28Z,Monica Augustyniak,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSgZwP3f11_XeOYXzAsUi6eTLs-g_umU7NsNg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

It‚Äôs scary how MOST people get this vaccine because they think it‚Äôs FDA APPROVED. But it‚Äôs only released under EUA... cuz of this pandemic. EUA literally means things are not fully PREPARED. EUA means the public becomes lab rats... 
they thoroughly study the true efficacy WHILE they test on us (the public). Let‚Äôs make sure we stay skeptical and alert. Thats all.
EUA rarely happens because pandemics rarely happen. While you think it‚Äôs totally reasonable- in this case with COVID.. this vaccine is known to cause ‚Äúimmune enhancement ‚Äú AKA ‚Äúpathogenic priming‚Äù and if you go even more in-depth about how our bodies react to the vaccine- scientists CAN predict where and how things can go wrong.  Esp bc previous covid (2003) vaccines FAILED. The problem is, these vaccine companies ARE NOT being transparent with us. Plus, animal tests and human trials nearly started simultaneously and the animal tests are not peer reviewed.

asymptomatic people have not been proven to transmit to other healthy persons walking down the street or in a shop - it is estimated that this is ""miniscule"" (UK Gov clips on bbc. 
Also Not proven is that the 2nd person ( the one you walked past in the street) who is healthy either a) becomes ill or
b) remains asymptomatic but who in turn passes it onto a 3rd person who passes it onto a 4th person and so on. 

Nor have they proved any of the above as a direct cause of death.

Add in that your diagnosis above is based either on
a) symptoms which occur in almost every RTI  eg coughs, colds, flu, chest infections, pneumonia , sinus infections.
And certainly cough, & loss of smell in allergies which may also be associated with a lot of mucus in nasal Airways
b) And or the PCR test which is not a specific test for viral RNA, & was not designed for it  & its inventor dr Mullis said it should not be used to diagnose infections.
It is a completely non-soecific test & it's results can be manipulated by how many cycles that you run - the higher the no. of cycles, the more (+) that are recorded. 
Also you would need the complete RNA sequences of C19 (- not just a sample of a few nucleotides) , which no-one appears to have ( 200,000 Euro reward by a group of researchers in Europe if anyone can prove the full sequence). 

That the diagnosis is so full of discrepancies & overlaps with numerous other respiratory infections & its testing is so  non-specific,
WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT ALTERING HUMAN IMMUNE RESPONSE ?
( and would you mind addressing why fit & healthy people need their immune system augmented at all ?  for any disease ? ) 

We have not clearly diagnosed any infection  to then form any idea of trends or behaviour of a disease.

The more PCR tests  you do, the more (+) you get.
The higher the no. of cycles done, the more (+) results you get.

What determines the no. of testing is arbitrary - local policy +/- people wanting or not wanting to be tested. 

What or who decides how mamy cycles are run in any test is arbitrary & varies from lab to lab.
we don't ( in UK) have public access to the no. of (+) results from tests run on 30, or 35, or 40 or 45 cycles. 
Positives over 35 are said to be unreliable & over 40 as False (+). 

Of Covid-19 deaths last year, none had a post mortem to confirm cause.
Up until the PCR test was being done routinely ( eg August??) people were being buried :-
-without any  test  for  C19
-without post mirtem proof of C19

So they were seriously ill  from one or many diseases, but any  cough or temp within 28 days or even 60 days prior to death meant the cause of death automatically became Covid.


So what IS the disease that these Pharmaceutical companies are rushing full pelt into making unprecedented vaccines ( DNA material) in an unprecedented time scale ?",2021-04-09T14:00:10Z,zero tolerance for Satanic Elite,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRp8g2om2Djzr_FUP-EOhJYbC1m6EwHOuk3DA=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

It‚Äôs likely that some simple policy changes‚Äîespecially shutting down visitations to nursing homes sooner, and providing more P.P.E. and testing to nursing-home staff‚Äîwould have saved lives.

UgxubBVgqyw8DpsqLi94AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"What if it is all prepared just to vaccinate people to immunize them against a future 100 percent deadly virus( created long ago but not spreaded).?When released, to kill everybody except special vaccine immunized people? Perfect depopulation down to exact numbers of specially vaccinated people! Number of survivers would be equal to numbers immunised only by the Special vaccine!
Biggest challenge would be to produse a vaccine without using any components of the deadly virus to be untrakable. With the clasic way of making the vaccine they had to use the weakened deadly virus or components of it. Which would have been visible by the scientist when they check it! So the solution came with the new syntetic Mrna vaccine which does not contain any virus or components of the virus. Instead immunisation is done by injecting a code, a program! So Without virus particals there are no proof (against which more versions of the same Virus that people are being immunised)! Only against simple covid 19 or also against a deadly original version of covid?
So if they first immunise target numbers of people to survive against a 100% deadly virus (against a virus which is created in the past but not released, not circulating yet, waiting to be released) and After they release and spread the virus the Result would be: everybody ( vaccinated with other brands or unvaccinated) dies, except their special vaccine immunised people! 
WHAT IF ; 
1- They genetically modified and created a few versions of a Sars virus,¬† a killer version( not covid19) and a few other weaker, less contagios, less dangerous versions( covid 19 and up to now circulating other mutations)?
2- What if, then they released the Covid 19 version to start a pandemic to have a reason to vaccinate worldwide people?
3- What if, after they created a vaccination program with risk groups to separate people into age, health conditions and very detailed job CATEGORIES and give priorities to each Category to set their group vaccination time? To deliver the special vaccine in the right time to reach to their desired, mostly young essential workers without any chronic disease or handicaps? Maybe One vaccine company delivered its special vaccines only when that country is about the vaccinate their essential workers risk group? And waited Pfizer or Astra zeneca to vaccinate almost all of the old, sick, handicap people to eliminate them (when the deadly virus will be released all except special vaccine immunised people would die)? 
4- what if they placed all the political, juridical, defence Authorities in priority groups and vaccinated them before the special vaccine arrived ? To eliminate all in power and to erase all goverments to set One world goverment?
So is that why Moderna vaccine Mrna is kept secret? If Pfizer and Moderna they were both made against the same covid 19 virus they should have the same resulting spike protein? Or the extra effect necesarry to imunise people against not only covid 19 but also a killer original ,unreleased version comes from Moderna's 200 micrograme of Mrna vaccine( while Pfizer Mrna vaccine uses only 60mcrgr)? Like a higher dose of antibiotics used for worse infections? Maybe using only 30mcrgr of Moderna vaccine would create enough immunity for simple covid 19? Can any patalog, genetic¬† scientist test this? If it still creates immunity with total 60mcrgr then what is the extra 140mcrgrm for? To get immunity for the future upcoming deadly mutation?
What might be the real reason of this unending pandemic? Will it all end with a genocide, saying to survivers"" it was a deadly covid 19 mutation but Moderna was still efficient and save you"" ? Will they continue vaccinating mostly workers survivers with new ingredients to digitalize and use the them for their 4th industrial revolution?
Are these just coincidences? What if Not? Are we gonna wait to see soon after they immunise their target number of workers (only from the countries they sold Moderna¬† Israel. America, Eu countries) if they release and wipe us all( vaccinated with other brands or unvaccinated)? Nobody to survive from African, Asian,South American countries no Moderna was sold to them?
What if all the dreams of them (Reducing the population down to exact numbers, resetting all political juridical financial,educational and medical systems, eliminating all world's authorities , erasing all goverments to set One world goverment)Just by vaccinating target people against a deadly, future to be released covid version ( while immunising against covid 19) and releasing it after to kill everybody except immunised necesarry not old, clinically healthy, no handicap mostly workers from the exact jobs desired?
Please check delivery dates of Moderna vaccines: to each country at different dates but always around beginning of that country is about to begin vaccinating their essential workers. Perfect delivery times assures that Most of Moderna vaccines are given to younger,healthier essential workers from desired jobs! Did Pfizer and Astra zeneca's sudden production problems and delivery delays help Moderna to reach at right times to vaccinate the right people?
Why suddenly all the rich started to talk about taking care of the climate and enviroment? (Now that they are about the own the World completly?)
Let's ask authorities to publish age,health conditions and job details of already Moderna vaccinated millions of people. Similarities would be another proof!
Check what jobs are placed at priority groups and you will see exactly who they need? It is like a job application just this time if you are qualified with your age, health and job details and if you are from a country where Moderna is delivered, you might get Moderna and survive!
Check World economic forum official site to see that they talked about what to do in case of a world wide contagious virus and took decisions as : all the giverments to listen recomandations and restrictions guidelines and closing businesses, schools, borders. But this meeting was a few months before covid 19 ever appeared!
Check their official site videos where rich people talks about resetting all systems, digitalizing human body and 4th industrial revolution to see what kind of a slavery life is waiting the survivers!
Authorities did not get Moderna! They were given priorities and vaccinated with Pfizer or Astra zeneca before Moderna was delivered! This is our chance to unite! If we can just inform them we might change the present and future of humanity! It is in your hand! Just share this message with everybody, everyway possible especially internationally!¬† The internet will be cut to stop this message from going viral.
Let's share this message to end this and all future pandemics!

This was probably left out by Zach because it is a complicated process to go through and I thought Zach did the video justice by simplifying this bit out so that it does not take away from the key message: both vaccines stimulate production of protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. 

The jist is there are two (classical) ways that B cells can be activated: T-cell dependent or T-cell independent. T-cell dependent activation of B cells (which most current research seems to suggest) occurs when the right B cells circulating in your blood encounters the antigen (generated in response to the vaccine). When this happens the B cell internalises the antigen and presents it on its own MHC Class II receptors (as Zach pointed out). These are then recognised by helper T cells that have also been activated by the antigen. This mutual recognition of antigens causes the T cell to activate the B cell (the molecular details for this is super cool but its too much detail to go through!). This activation causes the B cell to proliferate and differentiate to plasma cells that will then make the protective antibodies you need to fend off the infection (in other words, the T cells 'help' B cells to activate thus, their name as 'helper' T cells). I should say that this is a general (classical) description of T cell dependent activation for most antigens and I cannot be 100% certain if the same pathway is true for SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

The other pathway is T cell independant activation. As the name suggests, B cells encountering the antigen here, do not require the T cell's help to activate. They jump straight to making antibodies. However, it is often that antibody immunity from this pathway is not particularly robust in comparison to T cell dependent activation. I haven't followed much with SARS-CoV-2 related literature but most research publications that I have encountered suggests that B cells recognising the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein require T cell activation (again, I cannot be 100% certain that this happens in all cases). 

And this is only just scratching the surface of immunology. There is so much out there we don't quite know yet like why do some antigens seem to require T cell activation and some do not? Anyway, I hope this helps!",2021-07-01T11:31:35Z,Wai Hoe Chin,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRvlnWZ2GbLjbwF9ZJKuRbNaCKh9_ffcs58giRSHA=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Permanently (genetically) inducing our cells to produce outdated , old  genetic viral material does nothing but weaken our immune system by committing it to false enemies that we constantly and permanently produce. The real effects of MRNA vaccines will therefore be, beyond those who die immediately, in the medium to long term autoimmune diseases cancer rare and unknown diseases. To affirm that, however, even if we are not immune we can mitigate the severity of the disease is false because this normally occurs in millions of unvaccinated people who are asymptomatic or not very symptomatic even if they are not vaccinated, the severity or not of the disease depends exclusively on the strength of our immune system. Therefore these genetic experiments of sorcerer's apprentices will be remembered as a disaster for humanity in the coming years. After 1 month both a recovered and a fully vaccinated person, although they can demonstrate the presence of antibodies, these are specific and therefore useless to neutralize the mutations of sarscov2.

Thank you for specifying this, which wasn‚Äôt clear. 
This opens door to my curiosity, and maybe you‚Äôre able to answer further. 
So, what happens to a cell when it‚Äôs infected, and y is it ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù by the immune system to kill it? Does it duplicate, so that you have more infected cells? Does it produce hormones it shouldn‚Äôt produce? Or what else?
And what do you mean by ‚Äúinfected‚Äù in this specific context (that the immune system attacks cells of the body instead of just the virus)? Is it generally when the virus enters the cell, or is it when it enters the nucleus, or what?
Thank you very much for your help.

Btw, I still don‚Äôt get why in the video they had to silence that part, pause and write the text where this concept is mentioned, twice. Is it to avoid YouTube‚Äôs algorithm somehow? Why should it be controversial, then? 
Or is it rather just a post production editing, because they forgot to mention and include this aspect in the first place?

If the cell is killed before it has a chance to be used as a weapon against the body, this is good. This is similar to a military tactic called scorched earth where the goal is to destroy anything that may be useful to an enemy. For example a retreating army may burn all the crops to prevent the advancing army from using it as a food source even though they may be burning the crops of their own citizens.

Not all germs reveal themselves to our immune system at the same time. Cold viruses, for example, are more easily detected by our immune system. But with other viruses such as the flu... Influenza viruses have an evolutionary advantage where it can multiply in your cells undetected for a while before truly revealing itself to your immune system. That evolutionary advantage it has developed is a part of the reason why the flu hits us so hard and so fast. It divides undetected in our bodies much longer than usual, and the alarm is raised in our bodies late. These vaccines immediately show a red flag to your immune system with the spiked protein - your body is able to destroy the cells fast because it can identify the infected cells quickly. My guess is Moderna kills off more cells than Pfizer because Moderna inserts more material than Pfizer does. But this is not necessarily a scary or bad thing - if you've ever had the flu, your body had to kill off far more cells than you'd probably be comfortable knowing, since it knows how to cloak itself longer.",2021-05-21T05:08:32Z,eukaryote90,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRFK5vode5g0mOju6y5aiWyqHkbXUiWD27pwn-d=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Ugxib1Owz8kH9J3Wx3J4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"Followed this video to see the different stages of development of a vaccine which was presented as 'generally speaking', not specifically pointing out how this was done with the injections listed on the right. Already know that they've been trying for almost twenty years to develop a coronavirus vaccine IN VAIN and the tests never made it past Phase 1, as it was killing animals. Was NEVER passed by the Food and Drug Administration as being safe for human use EVER. Until the pandemic came along and now they are being permitted with the understanding that they are still in the experimental stages without previously being successfully tested on animals, let alone a small number of humans, and in the case of an emergency are used with no liability to the producers and no guarantee of success to the recipients. 

Then he jumps from there to say these injections listed on the right are coming out of Phase 3 of the testing. REALLY?  Can you give any evidence and references to show that suddenly a successful coronavirus vaccine has been found, after almost twenty years of trying in vain?  Where is such information so people can read the results for themselves - how any of these injections were successfully tried on animals first, then a small number of humans, then larger numbers, then the public in general?  Those test results are badly needed to prove to countless people who are in doubt, that they were in fact done.  Unless, of course, they weren't. 

Thanks for the list on the left. Very useful information. But it's too big of a leap to just believe that suddenly, out of nowhere, the injections listed on the right magically appear on the market out of Phase 3, when there was persistent failure at Phase 1 and they went no further until pandemic time.",2021-03-28T15:24:29Z,Maya David,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRskuytx-ufmDx0iG11Os-5ry08PyIH1lNXOg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

No knowledge of biochemistry, this could be a no brainer question, but I've constantly hit this knowledge wall. No one explains why it can't get into the cell nucleus. I've found a process called transfection, where they use RNA as a vehicle to get into the cell nucleus. So yeah would really love someone to point me to the science here please. Also, if the Ribosome is in itself partly comprised of RNA, what does this new synthetic RNA do to the existing ribosome. What can it do it the ribosome. What are the possible problems with playing with the ribosome like this. There only ever seems to be puff pieces re positives. No mention of risks here. My role involves a lot of risk analysis for large company purchases in order to get approval. Where is the listing of risks so we know what risk we are accepting on when approval is required? What are the possible worst case scenarios in 1, 2, 10, 20 years down the track? This isn't like other vaccines I've been vaccinated for. I expect a full list of ALL possible Risks.

Transfection does not use RNA as a vehicle to get into the cell nucleus, and the ribosomal RNA cannot be modified in any way by added RNA, as it would otherwise be modified all the time by our own mRNA (or all the RNA that enters our cells from viral infections).",2021-03-28T07:18:05Z,Marco,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTEKDGDSRLZhzMrjm7uujj6ysCJKm-KhMKpbQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Even stunning is this new info, that will TRASH the Pfizer Moderna Astrazeneca all these weasles' claims...

Vaccine makers rarely use inert placebos (such as a saline shot), which is the gold standard for drug trials. Instead, they typically assess the safety of a new vaccine against another vaccine. This hides side effects, as most vaccines have side effects and risks.

The Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is being tested against a meningitis vaccine, which shares many of the side effects reported from COVID-19 vaccines.
Pfizer and Moderna have started offering placebo recipients in their trials the real mRNA gene therapy, which means it will be even more difficult to tease out which side effects are actually caused by the shot and which ones aren‚Äôt, over the long term.

In one clinical trial for the Moderna vaccine in Lenexa, Kansas, virtually all of the 650 volunteers who initially received the placebo have opted to get the real vaccine, which means there‚Äôs essentially no comparison group left for the ongoing study, which was slated to run for two years.

Some argue that placebo arms aren‚Äôt needed in COVID-19 vaccine trials, but their argument hinges on the idea that the vaccine being tested is known to be safe, which it absolutely is not at this point, and won‚Äôt be for many years.

And then there's your claim that ""absolute being the prime indicator of efficacy"". That's a problematic claim - as an absolute risk reduction for e.g. viral infections also should include a time-frame. I may have a 1% absolute risk of getting COVID in a 2-months period, but that risk increases over longer time frames when that viral infection is just allowed to go around. At some point it decreases again, but that's when you've reached herd immunity.

Oh, and a 1% absolute risk reduction means, in this case, millions of people no longer at risk...",2021-03-23T08:08:54Z,Marco,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTEKDGDSRLZhzMrjm7uujj6ysCJKm-KhMKpbQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

And yet we can. Because it really does not need to take 10 years. A very, very important reason that it often takes long is all the waiting time between the different phases. Try recruiting volunteers for a trial - and not just six, but hundreds. You'll have to wait until sufficient people have applied who fulfill the criteria. Oh, and you'll likely have to wait until the site(s) where you do your study are done with their other clinical trials that were already planned. Then you get results back, and your company scientists pour over the data to see if your product is good enough to hopefully have such a beneficial effect that it can earn back it costs for development - with a good look at the competition that may already be on the market. Let's say it is - now you need even bigger trials. More delays in getting sufficient volunteers recruited - and since you need many more, you likely need to do this in several different countries. Long discussions about the right read-out to show efficiency, which can be quite tricky for a vaccine when the disease itself is not very prevalent. In that case you may have to wait for a long time to be sure it indeed gives a protective effect (because you cannot challenge people with this virus). An added issue is that you would, with most vaccines, like to have long-term protection, or otherwise it is unlikely to be of societal interest. So, more waiting time to make sure the immune response lasts for long enough.

But this is a different situation, where we not only had little trouble getting volunteers, there also was less concern about having a long-term (years) immune response for these vaccines to be beneficial. It's very much like the influenza vaccines, where *every year there are new vaccines*.",2021-03-20T09:43:35Z,Marco,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTEKDGDSRLZhzMrjm7uujj6ysCJKm-KhMKpbQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

What happens if the 2nd dose is given 3 to 4 months after due to perhaps shortage of supply. Will then efficacy change?  2) if Pfizer and Moderna are pretty much the same why the difference in storage temperature requirements? 3) what would happen if you got Pfizer or Moderna and later got AstraZeneca, would proteins double and create even more antibodies?

‚óè‚ÄùIf I get vaccinated can I stop wearing a mask(s)?‚Äù

Government: ‚ÄúNO‚Äù

‚óè‚ÄùIf I get vaccinated will the restaurants, bars, schools, fitness clubs, hair salons, etc. reopen and will people be able to get back to work like normal?

Government: ‚ÄúNO‚Äù

‚óè‚ÄùIf I get vaccinated will I be resistant to Covid?‚Äù

Government: ‚ÄúMaybe. We don‚Äôt know exactly, but probably not.‚Äù

‚óè‚ÄùIf I get vaccinated, at least I won‚Äôt be contagious to others ‚Äì right?‚Äù

Government: ‚ÄúNO. the vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop transmission.‚Äù

‚óè‚ÄùIf I get vaccinated, how long will the vaccine last?‚Äù

Government: ‚ÄúNo one knows. All Covid ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù are still in the experimental stage.‚Äù

‚óè ‚ÄúIf I get vaccinated, can I stop social distancing?‚Äù

Government: ‚ÄúNO‚Äù

‚óè ‚ÄúIf my parents, grandparents and myself all get vaccinated can we hug each other again?‚Äù

Government: ‚ÄúNO‚Äù

‚óè ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the benefit of getting vaccinated?‚Äù

Government: ‚ÄúHoping that the virus won‚Äôt kill you.‚Äù

‚óè‚ÄùAre you sure the vaccine won‚Äôt injure or kill me?‚Äù

Government: ‚ÄúNO‚Äù

‚óè‚ÄùIf statistically the virus won‚Äôt kill me (99.7% survival rate), why should I get vaccinated?‚Äù

Government: ‚ÄúTo protect others.‚Äù

‚óè‚ÄùSo if I get vaccinated, I can protect 100% of people I come in contact with?‚Äù

Government: ‚ÄúNO‚Äù

‚óè ‚ÄúIf I experience a severe adverse reaction, long-term effects (still unknown) or die from the vaccine will I (or my family) be compensated from the vaccine manufacture or the Government?‚Äù

Government: ‚ÄúNO ‚Äì the government and vaccine manufacturer‚Äôs have 100% zero liability regarding this experimental drug‚Äù

So to summarize, the Covid19 ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù‚Ä¶

Does not provide immunity

Does not eliminate the virus

Does not prevent death

Does not guarantee you won‚Äôt get it

Does not stop you from passing it on to others

Does not eliminate the need for travel bans

Does not eliminate the need for business closures

Does not eliminate the need for lockdowns!!!

breakdown by Irishman1776

All these statements are factually and verifiably TRUE. Look it up!
I should also add this: COVID-19 is similar to the flu = YEAH it is. The estimated actual death rate is 0,26%. That‚Äôs from the CDC themselves. WHO actually says it‚Äôs 0,14% . The 0,26% number includes everyone. This means you have a 99,74% chance of mastering coronavirus without a problem. NO VACCINE WILL EVER come close to YOUR AMAZING immune system. If you remove anyone at age 70+, it‚Äôs more like 0,03% death rate WHICH IS NOTHING!!! COVID-19 is old people. We should have ONLY focused on helping them and NOT destroying the entire world and the lives of 85% of the world‚Äôs population. Since when is 85% FORCED to destroy their entire lives for the 15%? Is it my fault grandma is sick and does she really want her country and the economy (she helped build) to be DESTROYED with increased suicides, increased domestic violence, increased drug abuse and deaths, increase alcoholism, 100s of millions more to die in the third world etc - just so grandma can live 1-3 more years?

It helps with your sniffles and your cough, BUT as we speak, the results from the conclusion of these trials, have the vaccine cartels themselves admitting publically, on their websites, about the true effectiveness of the vaccines.

Up until this point in time every human being would say that WHEN WE SAY vaccine, it means that it is A SAFE PRODUCT that STOPS INFECTION and STOPS you TRANSMITTING it to others. So, anything that just MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER or alleviates SYMPTOMS, is JUST a TREATMENT. They have done a 'bait and switch' trick to the world by REINVENTING the DEFINITION of what a vaccination is. If it DOSNT stop INFECTION AND DOSNT STOP THE TRANSMITION of infection, then how are we going to get to HERD IMMUNITY. Herd immunity is another term they REDEFINED because again, up untill this point in time, every human being would agree that HERD IMMUNITY can be achieved through NATURAL INFECTION.

This is another banger that helps everyone get engaged and understand the mechanics of this technology. 

Quick Reference to the FDA briefing Doc on Pfizer and BioNTecH.

 On page 42 it explains a group called ""Suspected Covid Cases"" which is not included i the Pfizer and BioNTech Literature we currently Have. 

Paragraph States
""Among 3410 total cases of suspected but unconfirmed COVID-19 in the overall study
population, 1594 occurred in the vaccine group vs. 1816 in the placebo group. Suspected
COVID-19 cases that occurred within 7 days after any vaccination were 409 in the vaccine
group vs. 287 in the placebo group. It is possible that the imbalance in suspected COVID-19
cases occurring in the 7 days postvaccination represents vaccine reactogenicity with symptoms that overlap with those of COVID-19. Overall though, these data do not raise a concern that protocol-specified reporting of suspected, but unconfirmed COVID-19 cases could have masked clinically significant adverse events that would not have otherwise been detected""

What can we understand if these numbers were investigated further?
By my account, this falls within the range that would diminish the efficacy below the acceptable range we were first looking for. Any follow up insight on this would be great.",2021-03-17T05:26:52Z,ForHisGlory 2419,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT2suSfq_axwLZz64uL7IberRCK1EThN1hnQQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Thanks for the response Marco...

I would accept that however, are we applying the same measure we do in the real world application of symptoms? 

Are we saying people who demonstrate Covid-like symptoms are not getting Covid in the placebo group or in the vaccine group and are nothing to test about? 
If so, why the insanity to test everyone all the time who demonstrate no symptoms to do rather benign things. 

There is a certain percentage that has to be getting Covid in the placebo group. 

The entire world is assuming if you have Covid like symptoms then you have Covid...and act as such until you know better. 

I would say, if the placebo group were getting Covid like symptoms... 
and the vaccine arm of the trial also expressed these Symptoms then we have an obligation to investigate this through, not leave them unconfirmed and thus eliminate them from the trials efficacy altogether. 

We had an obligation to PCR test all those expressing symptoms...

We threw billions into these vaccines, surely there was enough money to pay for a PCR test for each person in the group. 

Should we assume 1800 people in the placebo group all just started feeling sick but not from Covid? 

Even if 25% of the unconfirmed group were Covid that would severely hamper that 95% effective rating we are touting and celebrating. 

Also from the demo the 95% efficacy is relative to the placebo group expressing symptoms. 
This may be great at preventing symptoms of Covid, but does nothing perhaps to stop the transmission and Potential asymptomatic infections of the virus. 

We are potentially talking hundreds of people in the vaccine group contracting Covid within a relatively short period of time, and one would have to assume if the vaccine is preventing nothing but clinical symptoms at this point, not infection.!

Preventing symptoms is still a win and I would accept that post pandemic. 

However preventing symptoms solely will  not get us to herd immunity which should be the primary END-Point of the trials.",2021-03-18T13:56:44Z,ForHisGlory 2419,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT2suSfq_axwLZz64uL7IberRCK1EThN1hnQQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

I just can't understand why the majority of the population is just eager to take such a vaccine. The astra-zeneca vaccine has been put on hold here in the Netherlands as well, given the possibility of problems with blood clotting. So one time the government says, take that shot. This is the solution. And then, oh no, wait, we'll stop it. Maybe it's not quite right after all. We also have no idea what this will do in the longer term. And it is downright ridiculous if we are forced to do so. Do we really have to walk around with a certificate to be allowed to cross the border? Or to a concert? I don't understand the people who accept it like this and don't use their common sense. I am against the vaccination requirement.

Ugz4TMnIhmSVIfDap_F4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"He is listing animal trials which would normally be the first phase but I thought these vaccines skipped animal trials and went straight to human trials which is how they produced it so fast. Also, supposedly with SARS-Cov-1 and MERS, they could not pass the animal trials because when the disease was re-introduced, they went into cytokine storm which is a way over active immune response something nobody wants to go through. I'm still watching the video and I hope he addresses this and also hope he truthfully addresses whether these mRNA experimental therapies (they aren't vaccines yet) affect ones DNA because everything I learned in A&P has DNA and RNA working in tandem coding for various proteins for the human body to function. I would hate for this to be, say, gene splicing which is kind of how Moderna advertises their vaccine to operate. Lastly, I find it interesting how a 2 to 3 year old company that developed a mRNA platform but never before made a vaccine was able to make their ""safe and effective"" vaccine plus mass produce it in such a short time. I'm not anti-VAX I just would like to know what this mRNA is actually doing and how it can basically just make these certain proteins and not mutate like most RNA strands do over time and will their mutations still be safe and effective say in 5 years or 10 years down the road.",2021-03-11T13:41:18Z,Old Man Neal,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQYtmq0t00T6SXa3B_lIwR9Cv8fjA_cWHwlkN0JSA=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Health authorities in England have announced that not a single case of 
influenza, out of 685,243 tested, has been detected this year. These 
authorities theorize that the miraculous elimination of flu cases is due
 to wearing masks, social distancing, and people taking the flu vaccine.

 cases are being falsely counted as COVID cases. Top epidemiologist Knut

This does not provide immunity to anything. In a best-case scenario, it merely reduces the chance of getting a severe case of a virus if one catches it. Hence, it is a medical treatment, not a vaccine. I do not want to take a medical treatment for an illness I do not have.
2.
The drug companies, politicians, medical establishment, and media have joined forces to universally refer to this as a vaccine when it is not one, with the intention of manipulating people into feeling safer about undergoing a medical treatment. Because they are being deceitful, I do not trust them, and want nothing to do with their medical treatment.
3.
The presumed benefits of this medical treatment are minimal and would not last long in any case. The establishment acknowledges this, and is already talking about additional shots and ever-increasing numbers of new ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù that would be required on a regular basis. I refuse to turn myself into a chronic patient who receives injections of new pharmaceutical products on a regular basis simply to reduce my chances of getting a severe case of a virus that these injections do not even prevent.
4.
I can reduce my chances of getting a severe case of a virus by strengthening my immune system naturally. In the event I catch a virus, there are vitamins and well-established drugs that have had wonderful results in warding off the illness, without the risks and unknowns of this medical treatment.
5.
The establishment insists that this medical treatment is safe. They cannot possibly know this because the long-term effects are entirely unknown, and will not be known for many years. They may speculate that it is safe, but it is disingenuous for them to make such a claim that cannot possibly be known. Because they are being disingenuous, I do not trust them, and I want no part of their treatment.
6.
The drug companies have zero liability if anything goes wrong, and cannot be sued. Same for the politicians who are pushing this treatment. I will not inject myself with a new, experimental medical device when the people behind it accept no liability or responsibility if something goes wrong. I will not risk my health and my life when they refuse to risk anything.""",2021-02-28T09:26:14Z,memee,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRjFdpo4BUjLUBlXttJi8zt3mR6EphfgiMZhw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

If it is able to use host transcriptases to code for mRNA, is there a chance that also host endonucleases and ligases could splice it in the host genome? I mean, if it only ends up ultimately coding for the S-protein I guess it wouldn't really matter...but, it seems there is more room for error in transcription into RNA by having this extra step? I have too many questions lol. I don't know enough and can be missing a major compomemt that keeps this from happening, but without that information, the lipid nanoparticle coated mRNA vaccines seem like the less complicated and better choice.

This is one factor science is unable to investigate. The body is scientifically or biologically a machine made up of over 150,000 different proteins. The proteins provide for your physical structure and for your life functions. The energy in your body that controls the protein is a vital force. The new science brings back the old story of vital forces controlling life.   I have a good connection with this vital source and it combats invading viruses as and required. It produces antibodies naturally without mechanical interference. I have just received the AstraZeneca Jab and the following day I experienced the flu I was given which went to my brain mostly in the frontal lobe, not happy with this invasion of previously happy healthy bodily state.  The vital force was being blocked off from its normal high state of energy vibration to a much denser lower state of consciousness while this invasion was being dealt with.

Everyone was thoroughly impressed with the 95% effective claim. 
 
However, this was based upon relative risk reduction. That is the declared percentage difference between the vaccinated group‚Äôs 8/18310 chance (0.044%) of developing COVID-19 against a 162/18319 (0.884%) chance of COVID-19 symptoms without the vaccine. As a larger group of 43,000 people have yet to be trialed, there is no basis for this claimed outcome. 

It should be noted this only refers to an alleged reduction of COVID 19 symptoms among those who have the virus. The tested endpoints do not demonstrate that the vaccine will either reduce the spread of infection or save lives. It should also be noted that these figures suggest the threat from COVID-19 is vanishingly small.

Using Pfizer‚Äôs figures, the relative risk reduction = 100 [1 ‚Äì (0.044/0.884)]. Which is 95%. Voila! This sounds fantastic and is a much better marketing strategy than reporting the absolute risk reduction.

The absolute risk of developing COVID-19 symptoms without the vaccine is supposedly 0.884% and with the vaccine 0.044%. 
In absolute terms, the effectiveness of the vaccine is (0.884 - 0.044 = 0.84%).
 Would you consider 0.84% a decent 'efficacy' ?  Oh, I know, everyone hates math...

The good thing about the vaccine is that your (adaptive) immune system already ""knows"" the virus and immediately starts acting when the virus enters our body. Without the vaccine, and no matter how much vitamin D you have, your (adaptive) immune system will first need to get started and learn how to cope with this virus - this usually takes many days, meaning the virus has almost free reign for those days to multiply.",2021-02-19T09:55:46Z,Marco,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTEKDGDSRLZhzMrjm7uujj6ysCJKm-KhMKpbQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Infection primes immune response much more efficient than a vaccine. Vaccine is life saving when producing antibodies & co via infection has a high cost = you die or have injury (like in polio, ebola etc). Vaccine is useless (no benefit and potentially risk) when producing antibodies via infectios has low or none cost and that is the case with covid19: 80% of people infected with sarscov2 produce antibodies immediately and neutralize virus early on so it stops replicating and dont develop symptops (asymptomatic = no covid19 disease developed), 15% get to develop mild covid19 so still producing antibodies is at low cost, only 5% of infectios are at high cost. And those are people with critical deficiencies of vit D and if you correct it via Calcifediol (pre-hormone of vit D) they recover.

Let‚Äôs see, it is 2021 now, so ten years ago was 2011. But, mRNA can make the process much quicker. Say, halve it? OK. That means five years ago the process began. 2016. Both dates, for Covid19 are waaaay before anyone knew about Covid19. How is that possible? If mRNA is being done (we are told), in just two years, who in the world would or should trust something like this being done so fast? Calling it ‚Äúwarp speed‚Äù is just a selling point or brainwashing point. It doesn‚Äôt mean a thing toward safety and efficacy. Not a thing. Has nothing to do with those. Not enough test cases. Not enough time to truly check for safety and efficacy. Not enough time to know ‚Äúwhat these companies/people are really doing?‚Äù Also, it costs upwards of $500 million dollars for just one vaccine. Is there anything that could possibly make it faster, with more test cases and lower the cost significantly?  Yes, there is. Tell the world everyone MUST BE (forced), vaccinated and results then come back very quickly from many test cases, lowering cost, shortening time. Add to this that one of the first measures taken by these firms was to get legislation passed absolving them of any responsibility for bad things happening. They cannot be sued. They made sure of that FIRST. Finally, my body‚Äôs immune system ALREADY DOES ALL THIS THAT YOU DEMONSTRATED about the vaccine and how it works. When my body does it, it is natural and safe. When a human messes with it, it is called ‚Äútechnology‚Äù. When a human messes with it, they ‚Äúmess it up.‚Äù Coronavirus is a cold/flu virus. Ever had one in your life? Then your immune system can now recognize the virus and launch its natural immune response. And, it also can recognize closely-related virus variants to CoV-2. Humans have never been able to create a vaccine for a cold virus. Never. And, they still can‚Äôt. Not for me.",2021-02-14T15:46:59Z,M.E.

UgwU1iDXeXxNxypN6Cx4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"There are thousand of things our immune system goes through when an unknown lethal antigen such as COVID19 virus is introduced inside our body. 

The very first thing our complex immune system must do is recognize it. 

As we age or have various diseases our immune systems is not always up to par to fulfill its duties to capture COVID19 and thus rendering it harmless to the trillions of cells inside our body 

Once COVID19 is introduced inside our body; for many of us elderly and younger vulnerable people; scientists knows that a Cytokines storm can takes place within our complex immune systems and continue even stronger as COVID19 easily attaches its Spike Protein to the ACE2 receptors of potentially trillion of cells inside our bodies. 

So based on your presentation; logic this tells me that the mRNA vaccines manufacturers the spike protein on the surface of our cells producing a significant immunological responds both good and bad. 

Unlike COVID19 The messenger RNA disappears in a few days; but it is still up to our complex immune system to then capture the spike protein that science has caused our body to make. The most potentially dangerous elements of the vaccines the drugs manufacturers are not telling us; you have revealed in your video

‚ÄúAfter primed by the vaccines the cytotoxic T-Cells release destructive molecules that destroy host cells if infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus in the future, not the host cells processing the vaccines at that time.‚Äù 

So if true this tells me all the new cells we make X months after the vaccines; if later infected with COVID19 or its variants we will have to get booster vaccines year after year after year. But also bear in mind that the vaccines are also manufacturing cytotoxic T-Cells against cells inside our body that were not previously immune by the Vaccines. 

So once we accept the vaccines; we all jump into the unknown that only time will reveal and no scientists or immunologist could possibly know.

UgyloSTPFOYkUr60Sz54AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"The vaccine will not protect you from any virus in any way. Even the flu vaccine doesn't protect people from becoming infected with influenza, actually the people who are getting the flu shot very often have worse symptoms when subsequently infected by the virus than the unvaccinated people.

And the way the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine works, I don't think it is meant to protect you against viruses, it has other purposes, not to protect you...The Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, while all vaccines in the past were stored between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius, and freezing them or exposing them to freezing temperatures was forbidden, as it was damaging the vaccine... Why the covid-19 vaccine needs to be stored in an ultra-low temperature? Simply because this is not a vaccine, this is genetic material. This is how genetic material or DNA is being stored.

Electroporation of mRNA into our cells is the method they will be using, which is supposed to make foreign proteins, that supposedly generates immunity. But the problem is, electroporation is literally a method for genetic modification, this is the exact same procedure they are using to transfer foreign DNA into the cells. No one knows what will happen when one gets injected with this vaccine, but my suspicion is that infertility will be the most common 'side effect'. Another very possible side effect is prion disease, as the mRNA vaccine instructs your cells to make protein it doesn‚Äôt normally make. It could be malformed. And malformed proteins lead to prion disease. This is incurable and fatal neurodegenerative disorder that has very long incubation period (several years) during which the disease may not reveal any signs.",2021-02-03T19:19:48Z,they know,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGyAw-TLcIF6rQkGsMSqAx1wkmYZ5pmw1t=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

In the studies, they give (randomly) either the vaccine or placebo to the participants. Afterward, all participants go about their daily lives. 
After some time, they gather data about how many people got infected and how severe their symptoms were. 
If the vaccine does NOT work, you would expect there to be roughly the same number of sick people in both the placebo and vaccine groups.

UgzUscHrBoMF4wCW0Sh4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"Thank you very much. I am still very very concerning about any vaccine to fight this virus. Please,  tell me I am wrong. The structure of this virus, the RNA chain is much longer, a thousand times longer, than any known virus. It is tightly packed into the capsule, its fine when it is  not activated but as soon as the virus entered the cell its structure is never the same due to constant exchanges of bases because of very weak connection in-between.  Therefore, the  virus is never the same, especially, when it will be passed to other hosts, next victim.. so, I understand that the protection is only to block the injection point  via recognizing the trigers but not to the virus itself. There is always mistakes when other enzymes ar involved to fix them. But,  its too late!  all consistent is has started to interfere already.  Please, say, I am wrong... i do not believe that vaccine can  help against exactly this virus ... because of its specificity",2021-01-22T19:51:18Z,Tatiana Lancing,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQHRYJxiSBb74nqnfrBMScLs5GFqDtTi7pgH5GN=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

What I really wonder about and couldn't find trying to research it in the internet is the fact you write down at 20:18 -> Why are the spike protein producing cells not effected by immune response of cytotoxic t-cells and are not getting killed? Because I thought normally when a cell presents pathogenic patterns on their MHC-I-Receptors they get targeted by the immune system.

UgxFaiRLLGCsFEoDTv14AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"The vaccin/gentherapie Don't take it, There are already 23 People death. Listen to Prof. Dr. Theo Schetters. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19-vaccin en Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccin. Wij zijn van de stichting Viruswaarheid. Deze stichting bestaat uit een groep bezorgde (huis) artsen, micro / moleculair biologen en juristen, die de belangen van de burgers voorop stellen. 
Op dit moment zijn wij in een fase gekomen dat het vaccineren tegen Covid-19 in Nederland wordt uitgerold en u zult de komende tijd dan ook starten met vaccineren. Onze mening is dat er onvoldoende rekening gehouden wordt met de mogelijke gevolgen. En wij willen u erop wijzen dat u ten alle tijde aansprakelijk gesteld kan worden indien zou blijken dat u onvolledige informatie heeft verschaft aan uw pati√´nten/ingeschrevenen voorafgaande aan de injectie. Deze vaccins maken gebruik van gentechnologie en vallen daarmee onder gentherapie strikt gesproken. De tijdelijke toekenning van een handelsvergunning onder voorwaarde is geen volledige goedkeuring of toegang tot de Nederlandse markt, maar is aan strikte voorwaarden gebonden.
Uiteraard bent u op de hoogte van de volgende artikelen uit de geneesmiddelenwet en overige informatie.
Maar omdat wij onze (acute) zorgen kenbaar willen maken aan u hebben wij deze hieronder voor u uitgelicht:
Geneesmiddelenwet artikel 84 
Reclame die het rationele gebruik van een geneesmiddel niet bevordert wegens het ontbreken van een objectieve voorstelling van zaken, is verboden.
Misleidende reclame is verboden.
Geneesmiddelenwet artikel 40
Het is verboden een geneesmiddel in het handelsverkeer te brengen zonder handelsvergunning van de Europese Gemeenschap, verleend krachtens verordening 726/2004 dan wel krachtens die verordening juncto verordening 1394/2007, of van het College, verleend krachtens dit hoofdstuk. 
Het is verboden een geneesmiddel waarvoor geen handelsvergunning geldt, in voorraad te hebben, te verkopen, af te leveren, ter hand te stellen of in te voeren. 
Een verbod als bedoeld in het tweede lid is niet van toepassing:
b. op geneesmiddelen voor onderzoek;
d. op geneesmiddelen voor geavanceerde therapie die met toestemming van het Staatstoezicht op de volksgezondheid worden bereid door een fabrikant volgens een recept voor een op bestelling gemaakt geneesmiddel dat voor een bepaalde pati√´nt op niet routinematige basis volgens specifieke kwaliteitsnormen en binnen dezelfde lidstaat in een ziekenhuis wordt gebruikt onder de exclusieve professionele verantwoordelijkheid van een arts; 
Het Staatstoezicht ziet erop toe dat bij de bereiding van een geneesmiddel voor geavanceerde therapie als bedoeld in het derde lid, onder d, de eisen ter zake van de traceerbaarheid, de geneesmiddelenbewaking en de kwaliteit van het middel gelijkwaardig zijn aan die welke gelden voor de bereiding van geneesmiddelen voor geavanceerde therapie√´n waarvoor een vergunning voor het in de handel brengen is vereist op grond van verordening 726/2004.
Geneesmiddelenwet 1.xx
Elke vorm van be√Ønvloeding met het kennelijke doel het voorschrijven, ter hand stellen of gebruiken van een geneesmiddel te bevorderen, dan wel het geven van de opdracht daartoe.
Geneesmiddelenwet 1.ijij
Publieksreclame: reclame voor een geneesmiddel die, gezien haar inhoud en de wijze waarop zij wordt geuit, kennelijk ook voor anderen dan beroepsbeoefenaren als bedoeld in artikel 82, onder a, is bestemd.
Wet medisch-wetenschappelijk onderzoek met mensen artikel 13c.
Het is verboden in het kader van gentherapie wetenschappelijk onderzoek met geneesmiddelen te verrichten dat gericht is op modificatie van de kiembaan en de daarin vastgelegde genetische identiteit van de proefpersoon.
Informed Consent
Het naleven door artsen van het beginsel van ‚Äòinformed consent‚Äô is volgens de KNMG niet alleen in juridisch opzicht van belang. Goede communicatie met de pati√´nt is goed voor het wederzijds vertrouwen en bevordert de therapietrouw. Het recht op informatie en het toestemmingsvereiste (tezamen informed consent) vormen de spil van de patieÃàntenrechten. Deze beide rechten zijn in de arts-patieÃàntrelatie van cruciaal belang, en dat niet alleen om juridische redenen. Informed consent kan evenzeer een hulpmiddel zijn om, door communicatie en interactie, het bereiken van therapeutische doeleinden te bereiken.
De Wet Geneeskundige Behandelingsovereenkomst (WGBO) geeft een wettelijke basis aan het informed consent. De wetgever had daarbij het oog op het vastleggen van reeds lang bestaande en erkende juridische en medisch-ethische plichten van de arts, en niet op het introduceren van nieuwe normen. Wel is het zo dat de inwerkingtreding van de WGBO de aandacht voor informed consent, en vooral voor de implementatie van het recht op informatie, heeft verhevigd.
De risico‚Äôs die niet zijn onderzocht
Immuungecompromitteerde personen De werkzaamheid, veiligheid en immunogeniciteit van het vaccin zijn niet beoordeeld bij immuungecompromitteerde personen, waaronder personen die met immunosuppressiva worden behandeld. De werkzaamheid van Comirnaty kan minder zijn bij immuungecompromitteerde personen.
Duur van de bescherming De duur van de bescherming die het vaccin biedt is niet bekend, omdat dit met lopende klinische onderzoeken nog wordt bepaald. 
Interacties met andere geneesmiddelen en andere vormen van interactie Er is geen onderzoek naar interacties uitgevoerd.
Er is geen onderzoek naar gelijktijdige toediening van Comirnaty met andere vaccins uitgevoerd.
Borstvoeding Het is niet bekend of Comirnaty in de moedermelk wordt uitgescheiden
ernstige allergische reactie, Niet bekend (kan met de beschikbare gegevens niet worden bepaald)
Goedkeuring
Het Europees Geneesmiddelenbureau heeft besloten tot uitstel van de verplichting voor de fabrikant om de resultaten in te dienen van onderzoek met Comirnaty bij pediatrische pati√´nten ter preventie van COVID-19 Dit geneesmiddel is geregistreerd in het kader van een zogeheten ‚Äòvoorwaardelijke toelating‚Äô. Dit betekent dat aanvullend bewijs over de baten van dit geneesmiddel wordt afgewacht. Het Europees Geneesmiddelenbureau zal nieuwe informatie over dit geneesmiddel op zijn minst eenmaal per jaar beoordelen en zo nodig deze SPC aanpassen.
Onderzoeksfase
In het onderzoeksrapport staat:

Een fase 1/2/3, placebo-gecontroleerde, dubbelblind, studie om de effectiviteit, veiligheid, tolerabiliteit, immunogeniciteit en effici√´ntie van het Sars-Cov-2 RNA-Vaccin-Kandidaten voor gezonde individuen, zou duren tot 27 januari 2023.
Dit betekent dat ieder individu die het vaccin toegediend zal krijgen, onderdeel uitmaakt van de studie. Stel uw pati√´nt / cli√´nt hiervan op de hoogte.
Alternatief voor vaccines die reeds peer reviewed zijn
Ivermectine, sinds Juni 2020
HydroxyChloroquine, sinds Oktober 2020
Budesonide, sinds Oktober 2020
Vitamine D, sinds juli 2020
Van welke groepen zijn werking en bijwerkingen van de vaccins onbekend of weinig bekend?
Dat zijn de groepen die uitgesloten zijn van deelname aan de onderzoeken of die weinig vertegenwoordigd zijn.
De producenten van het betreffende Pfizer vaccin hebben o.a.  de volgende  groepen uitgesloten:
kinderen tot 16 jaar 
mensen met een immuungecompromitteerde aandoening of het gebruik van immuunsuppressiva
mensen die sars-cov-2 al gehad hebben
Groepen die aan het Pfizer onderzoek hebben deelgenomen, maar weinig voorkwamen:
mediane leeftijd was 52 jaar (16 ‚Äì 91 jaar); ouderen zoals 75+ kwamen weinig voor
Diabetes mellitus
COPD
De producenten van het Moderna vaccin hebben o.a. de volgende groepen uitgesloten:
Zwangeren en zwangerschapswens binnen 3 maanden
Borstvoeding
Sperma donoren
Sars-cov-2, mers, sars in de voorgeschiedenis
Anafylaxie
Bloedstollingsstoornissen
Bloed donoren
Urticaria
Mensen met een immuungecompromitteerde aandoening of het gebruik van immuunsuppressiva
Gelet op de volgende bijwerkingen die wij voor u hebben uitgelicht, benadrukken wij het belang van deze brief:
Anafylactische shock
Verlamming
Overlijden
Allergie
Een auto-immuun ziekte
Allergie voor PolyEthylene Glycol (PEG). Dit is een bestanddeel van de vaccins maar zit ook in tandpasta, cosmetica zoals gezichtscreme, verdikkingsmiddelen. Op basis van petroleum.
Wanneer u bovenstaande informatie negeert en de ontvangers van het vaccin niet deugdelijk op de mogelijke bijwerkingen attendeert, loopt u het risico om naderhand door de rechter aansprakelijk te worden bevonden voor vaccin-schade.
Alleen wanneer u deugdelijk informeert, kan er sprake zijn van een informed consent. Een pati√´nt mag na instructie alsnog de behandeling weigeren.
Bedenk daarbij dat bij u de bewijslast ligt. U zult desgewenst moeten kunnen aantonen dat u aan uw verplichting dienaangaande heeft voldaan.
Met vriendelijke groet en de meeste hoogachting,

UgxpZkdn0o2qjauWkVd4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"Zach has the rare gift of getting a complicated subject over to non scientists. Can I ask Zach how did they test the trial participants positive? Were they using the over cycled RT PCR tests at 40 instead of 25/30? The placebo trial participants we read here in the UK received another vaccine not a saline placebo. The biggest worry now the vaccines are being rolled out is that the elderly are dying (Norway investigating) and those with allergies, are having severe reactions.  If I had an existing auto immune condition I would be very concerned. The question is how will these mRNA vaccines react in these individuals?  There has also not been a study produce definitive proof of asymptomatic transmission.  At the height of the infection when we wore no masks and just socially distanced, why did everybody not get ill immediately if it is so contagious and easily transmissible? No transmission in the summer months fir most of the country. Then they lock people down in the winter and make them breathe their own bacteria and cases rise.

And then there's the issue of getting into the nucleus - that ain't that easy!

I have already reported some time ago the FDA implementing prescriptions, according to which ‚Äúthere is no data available on the interchangeability of the Modern COVID-19 vaccine with other COVID-19 vaccines, including the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Individuals who have received one dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine should receive the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to complete the vaccination series.

Those who have recklessly decided to vaccinate, or those who have been induced by some social blackmail, are not guinea pigs anyway and have the right to obtain that the medical prescriptions on vaccines are at least respected.

UgxMD3rXB3A_kLhm0dt4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,Found this very helpful and easy to understand but from what I can gather Is we the public will be the lab rats for the side effects of this cov-19 vaccine and if and when we do come forward with all sorts of side effects in the next 10-15 years they will provide more pharmaceuticals for us to take again provided by who? So these big companies make millions/billions for the vaccines they have not long term tested then make even more money for any other pills/medicine they have us take to fight the side effects from this vaccine?

UgyH6ww68in1KmwLfjl4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"There's mention of pre-clinical saying you vaccinate the subject (mouse) first. Surely you'd actually have 'control' group of mice you won't vaccinate or infect and the test bunch that you will...kept apart from each other. Of the ones that you WILL vaccinate....obviously you'd split that into FOUR groups: ones you give the vaccine to BEFORE infecting with the virus...and ones you INFECT before giving the vaccine. Because practically, we would be vaccinating people in real-life who have already tested positive repeatedly...since 2019. Also a group you will vaccinate and not infect, plus a group you will infect and not vaccinate.

 Before vaccinating these mice or infecting them, you need to test them for the virus!! Otherwise how do you know if the vaccine works? As in how do you do a 'before and after' (vaccinating) comparison as to whether infection was prevented unless you have a pre-vaccination test to say ""negative""? 

Test your virus (delivery method) - You'd need to infect a subset of mice with the virus (after testing them prior) and check to see that they a) develop the expected and SAME core symptoms...and b) can be tested, eg PCR, to result as positive. This is to prove that your method of testing EFFICACY is valid (for when you test after vaccinating them). You need to know how long it takes after infection, to be able to reliably get a positive pcr off them, or find the virus in the blood, or see covid19 symptoms. Otherwise after vaccinating...and test-infecting, you might say ""it works""...only to find out that you should've waited longer. What if you first, get a mouse, infect it with the virus...and nothing happens!!!

You must test the infection process. a) intravenous injection b) mucous transfer and c) just let them mingle.
Reason: it's all well and good saying that there's a virus and that a vaccine can protect from the virus....but protect from what method of infection?? what if the virus can ONLY infect intravenously? Obviously, to be practical...we have to PROVE that regular, day-to-day contact is how it's transmitted.

it should be 'test-vaccinate-test-infect-test', and 'test-infect-test-vaccinate-test'.  You should use both positive and negative pcr subjects. Actually, it'd be also 'test-infect-test-vaccinate-test-infect-test'. The last one because you want to  see if they end up showing positive pcr after vaccination...and then test to see if tit prevents infection (efficacy).

You need to test the test control group of mice. Plus consider having some always isolated, and some 'together''.
You need to let the control group breed, and test the offspring. This is to see if how 'another dimension' they do...as a blueprint to what is 'normal'. Eg life expectancy, fertility, litter size/weight, cognitive function, generational health.

Of the mice you will infect-then-vaccinate....and the other group you will vaccinate-then-infect, you really need to have each group breed after the process. Then test the offspring, etc. You need to actually have mice that are elderly, young and even pregnant.

Something important is to.......wait. You MUST test for life-expectancy. This is being ignored.  Also for lifelong effects.
Eg if you vaccinate a young mouse, what happens at puberty age? Etc...
You'd also want to know how long infection lasts for....how long immunity lasts for....if non-immunised infected mice develop immunity, etc.

We rely on theoretical models too much. You cant do human trials and 'pass' them by giving them a vaccine (or any medicine, drug, etc) and saying 2 weeks later ""it's safe"". 

I actually thought animal trials were being skipped this time around...with the rush being justified due to emergency.

It's interesting that EVERYONE needs vaccinating, even though barely any (percentage) of people are seriously affected by the virus....and have already had it. 

Also...a couple of points. I mention PCR, which people say is dodgy. However, I mean pcr from an actual proven isolated viral sample. Also, I mean infecting a mouse directly...not theoretically in a petri dish.

My point is about theoretical models that have nothing to do with real-life application. Eg needing to use a litre of snot to infect a non-immunised person....yet locking down the whole world because they're not immunised.",2021-01-16T04:43:32Z,mrlawilliamsuk Warmachine,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR7p7JiPJZhEhRMoEfKlma-aLjxHakO6u9Ykw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgyWo-D7n5F_xlt2ETN4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"On the official website, as part of the authorization for the Moderna vaccine, FDA has answered some important questions about the use of the vaccine itself, including:
       Question: ""Are the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine interchangeable""?
       FDA response: ‚ÄúNo. There are no data on the interchangeability of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine with other COVID-19 vaccines, including the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Individuals who have received one dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine should receive a second dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to complete the vaccination series.
Individuals who have received one dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should receive a second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to complete the vaccination series. ""

This clarification is especially important for those European nations which, like Italy, have decided to supplement the stocks of the Pfizer vaccine with others of the Moderna vaccine.

In fact, according to the prescriptions of the FDA, it is essential that health professionals adopt organizational measures such as to provide that, during the vaccination cycle, the individual vaccinated are always given the same type of vaccine, without integrating it with a different one, even if the stocks of the first they are exhausted",2021-01-15T10:52:12Z,gianni paladini,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTaOFF9_L_Cp4YIWJCFhcYTlPsNyXPKHhLDfw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

For example, the ABSOLUTE risk reduction for Moderna is (185-11)/15000 or 1.16%. That‚Äôs abysmal and translates into a NNV OF 86, that is, 86 people must be vaccinated in order to benefit 1 person, while all 86 are subject to the vaccine‚Äôs side effects, some of which may be severe and life long!

Also, Moderna although has a better thermal advantage than Pfizer; it can only last for 1-month so if the establishment cant uses it all in time, it will result in a lot of wastage.

I was wondering, what is the selectivity for host cells of the two (actually three techniques, as the third one is using human adenoviruses). Do they ""target"" the same type of host cells? Because, I mean, the Tcy cells are most likely very specific, so imagine that you get a vaccine, and have these Tcy cells, then, for some reason you get a variant of the virus where this S protein is slightly different, so that the primary response is wrong (they target an inexistent S protein). Then I assume, the Tcy might still get activated, right? That might then become... well morbid, if they are specifically attacking the type of cell that was used by the vaccine and destroy them, say, massively. Even if these cells have nothing to do with the real infection... You see what I mean?

Until we know that the whole vaccine thing is pointless. Nobody who is healthy and has a 99%+ chance of nothing happening to them should take a vaccine if it's not going to prevent them spreading the disease anyway. There would be no point. You'd be better off vaccinating against a runny nose or blocked ears.

It's also worrying that they don't know what cells in our bodies might be affected and i've seen the question of the vaccine possibly causing an immune response on several videos now and not seen it answered.

So if the spike protein develops on our own cells, would exposure to the virus cause us to develop autoimmune symptoms as our bodies attack our own cells?

Though I must say I really raised my eyebrows when you talked about the difference in both placebo groups so little. The difference is very big to me. Out of 15.000 people in the 1st placebo group 30 had severe symptoms. The 2nd placebo group had 22.500 people of which 9 had severe symptoms. To me this only tells me that having a placebogroup with these superlow amount of people having severe symptoms in the first place, makes it hard to draw any solid conclusions out of it. Especially when comparing the two groups and working with these superlow numbers (0,035%) of NON vaccined people developed severe symptoms in the first place....

Ugw58iXIlPYVSh6DH6h4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"There are several concerns the general public needs to understand about the 3 main vaccine offerings (the 4th, from J&J is still undergoing review/approvals). First, the Moderna and Pfizer trials cannot be compared with the Oxford/AZ trials.  The Oxford trial was superior in many ways, because it used (a) longer duration for 2nd booster (28d), longer incubation period (14d), and MOST IMPORTANTLY it assessed ACTUAL INFECTION using PCR.

The Oxford/AZ trial actually determined how many participants were INFECTED (whereas the others look only at people who had symptoms -- those other trials likely had many more who were infected but presented with no/mild symptoms). Thus the Moderna and Pfizer clinical trials did not assess the vaccine properly. They left out people who BECAME infected after their vaccine regimen was used.

Given known details about the three vaccines, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine seems best able to stop this pandemic, in the fastest time. Their clinical trial assessed what is most important (true Infection rate) rather than what the other vaccine makers tested (""apparent infection""/only infections that showed symptoms).  If the Moderna and Pfizer clinical trials had tested for true infection rate, their percentages (Efficacy rate) would be significantly lower.  They designed their study using poor-quality methods, which artificially made their effectiveness appear higher.

Other important aspects for the general public:
- DATA VALIDITY & ANALYSIS -- how correctly did these companies conduct their trials & data analysis? Will they release data?
- STABILITY & DURATION OF INNOCULATION PERIOD -- for how long does the vaccine keep us immune? only 8 months?
- SAFETY -- all of these trials were run for shorter durations. We lack long-term data to really assess long-term safety.
- EFFICACY can be measured in many ways (the first method here was not tested, but is the most important)
  -> RATE OF TRANSMISSIBILITY (% of vaccine recipients who TRANSMIT the virus) == vaccine ability to stop spread
  -> RATE OF INFECTION (% of vaccine recipients who become INFECTED) == vaccine failure rate, per person
  -> RATE OF SEVERE DISEASE (% of vaccine recipients who get Severe COVID-19) == disease prevention rate, per person",2021-01-06T17:38:07Z,Who knew ¬∑¬∑¬∑,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRL3Lndm14ae2s_wqACLdNu_wt9qHFY-nxvdQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Ugzp_FhWO47PtHz095F4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"I have been following the scientific literature and trying to make sense of the problems. My lack of trust was partly because of the rash way the pandemic was handled.
All we can do is  look at the data. Since the beginning of this pandemic, all governments based their decisions almost uniformly ‚Äì with the exception of Sweden ‚Äì on the advice of a far too limited group of experts, mainly a few prominent virologists and influential infectious disease modellers, well known from previous activities in pandemic planning, e.g. swine-flu, avian flu, Spanish flu. These virologists and modellers argued that SARS-CoV-2 was a completely new virus, highly contagious and deadly to everybody in the population.  They calculate that an
uncontrolled SARSC2 epidemic would infect about 81% of the UK and the US population. Assuming an infection fatality rate of 0.9%, they predicted 510,000 deaths (UK) and 2.2 million (US) deaths respectively, and a worldwide death toll of 40 million (sourced). Thereby they convinced almost all governments to engage in a rigid suppression strategies until a vaccine becomes available.  They were obviously wrong in their models.

The possibility of pre-existing immunity was also not even considered (as was done  in the earlier epidemics like the swine-flu pandemic) For instance, during the swine-flu, the same  modellers predicted 30 million deaths worldwide from a new strain of the A/H1N1 virus, for which most people were thought to have no immunity. They were wrong. A CDC study conducted during the 2009 outbreak reported that 33% of people over 60 had cross reactive antibodies to the 2009 H1N1 strain. Hardly any people above age 60 were afflicted with swine-flu in 2009/2010 and in Germany the death toll of confirmed cases amounted to 258.  That just goes to show how foolish these modellers were but they managed to pedal enough vaccine. Being government and drug company-funded  made them even more suspicious.

Now if we look at the present stats, well see that in the official mortality statistics of the first seven months of 2020, there are some gross irregularities in the patterns of predicted and actually mortality between countries. 

 We most saw  some short term peaks of excess mortality especially in very old people, but for the most part,  the total mortality peaks leveled off quickly and overall the predicted magnitude of excess mortality did not occur (by the end of 7 months). That's when most people relying on natural herd immunity began to wonder what could possibly be achieved with all the sudden stringent measures after were clearly seen a drop in the death rates.  

For instance, in Germany total mortality showed no excess during the first seven months of 2020 compared to the average of the respective time period of 2016-2019.  
In comparison, in Belgium, with strict lockdown measures, the population based death toll from covid-19 was 8 times higher than in Germany. Sweden, on the other hand, followed a mitigation strategy without lockdown and  revealed  only 65% of the per capita Covid deaths of Belgium. 

So you can see that real world data didn't quite correlate with the  modelled projections (in terms of severity of covid-19 infection )
It is obvious that such discrepancies from experts of disease control would trigger doubts and suspicions.  It begs the question üëâWere such stringent  suppression strategies justified (OR as you alluded earlier is there's another agenda what ever you want to call it-- NWO or",2021-01-03T05:45:49Z,Badar Khan,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSvbabT3DJkkRXBjBKsXHfSLCbf23-rqRyDVQflGw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

both type vaccines you said that we create the mRNA re-engineer based on the Corona Virus Spike S-protein based, So when the Plasma cells generate the antibodies that antibody will just kill the COVID-19 virus corona spikes ONLY right ? not the whole virus which has the virus RNA,  I mean the the virus envelop or the capsule inside with the RNA still exists in the body, because these antibodies ONLY programmed to kill ONLY the spikes around the virus right ? (because we know these spikes are the gate way that interacted with the human cells to pass the virus RNA into our cells and generate the virus)  if this the case even we get the vaccine still we have these corona virus inside our body with out the spikes, envelops with the RNA virus code , true which mean they cannot get into our cells ? if that the case is that not a risk over time we accumulated load of virus in our body and in case if this virus mutated that if it finds a ways to release the RNA into our cells some other way ?  by that time we have loads of these ""Dormant Viruses"" in our body ? Could this happen or NOT ?  also there are other protein  except S-protein  the  ""HE-protein"" and M-protein""  any one who have BIO or virology knowledge please explain Thanks",2021-01-03T01:11:09Z,Johnny Jax,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRt_msik_Bftd3nb5dFcsRN_-1RLgIfGdkcvNal=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgyciF_30-SaqYz1pGV4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"Dear Zach. First: thank you very much for your great work. Here my question: How do you conclude that the cell that directly processes the mRNA strand and presents the spike protein next to its MHC molecule on its surface would not be destroyed by cytotoxic T cells? You emphasize that this would not happen and that only later really infected cells would be destroyed. From an immunological point of view, this makes no sense. A cytotoxic (CD-8) T cell that ""recognizes"" an antigen (associated with the MHC molecule) destroys the cell immediately, not only later through the memory-cells. Your statement suggests that the memory CD8 cells are formed first, but go into action later. To my knowledge, this is not the case for CD8 cells. Thank you very much for your great work and I look forward to your response.",2021-01-02T11:14:08Z,Damir del Monte,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ-fVJL_xIK-Wm5MvNQ88xvY62IWuvG5nQDkg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Isn't it that there will be ""plasma cells"" AND ""memory cells"" - the plasmas, they act immediately. I know you points from  question at a site called Stackexchange.  There, I think I answered with two points: immune cells who do the presenting in lymph nodes are not endangered by their helpful acting because they use some ""second signal"", do not remember the name, I guess it's called ""B7"" and that's a large column in textbooks. On the other hand, to my ""theory"" there is no presenting to CD8 at the site of infection - the presenting cells first have to go to the lymph nodes. - Any body cell which is no immune cell that presents I think, my opinion, would sooner or later be killed by primed, e.g. activated, immunized CD8, killers benign. And the teacher told us those cells are not enough to cause harm or storm? What's even more intricate is that the small part of m-RNA, which is tiny spike only, might lead to the demise of body cells (and, in the end, after presentation: the APCs that did the immunization as well, not much afterthought on their fate, that's my impression). That's the hick. 1. What kind of cells - muscles only? 2. most intricate to me: is the dying of body cells a prerequisite for the immunization of B-cells as they do not up take either whole viruses or nano particles (of vaccine). And then, even more complex: B-cells must present on MHCII, not I, in order to become activated in a second activation. And mRNA could not be considered ""exogenous"" antigen (can it? This I might ask the teacher). Anyway, it seems possible that what all here fear is a prerequisite of effectiveness, the demise of the muscle causing storm.",2021-01-06T11:29:08Z,Peter Bernhard,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQKyyJuo2HVaqcNzLDTaMJfUnutHjw5JeV1vg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

If for human's benefit such vaccines can be developed so quickly within a year, why can't medical companies be asked by govts. to develop oral medicines within a year to control population of stray animals also? They are dying painful deaths every moment. Nobody cares for them. So we need to develop oral medicines which can be given to them orally to control their population. Such oral medicines should be developed at the earliest with aim to make strays PERMANENTLY infertile. It is very important as they themselves cannot stop breeding. They don't have any place to live, don't have food, nobody to get them cured when they suffer badly from desease who suffer in extreme weather conditions. We need to stop this barbaric neglect of helpless animals. Doctors and Medical Researchers can take initiative in this matter.

The whole point of vaccines is that they produce the same kind of immune response as the real virus.  I believe it is not quite the same as only specific parts of the virus is presented to the immune system by a vaccine - this is actually better as the immune system concentrates its attack on important parts of the virus (the spike protein in this case).  On the down-side, there are fewer antigens in total as the real virus multiplies whereas the vaccine response does not so the overall numbers are lower.  If you already have memory B and T cells primed to go from your previous infection your response to the vaccine will be stronger, assuming your memory cells are targetting the same proteins (secondary immune response is much larger than the primary response - hence the two injections method for these vaccines) so topping-up your store of memory T and B cells with ones specifically aimed at the spike proteins.",2021-01-10T01:27:37Z,Bob Smith,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR3lYs_bcqEpaLzzC7ryYYia5hD0wI0MGBGZA=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

1) FDA, in a document of 11 December 2020 with which it approved the Pfizer vaccine, which bears the pompous title ""FDA Takes Key Action in Fight Against COVID-19 By Issuing Emergency Use Authorization for First COVID-19 Vaccine"", claims that the efficacy of the vaccine, based on the data provided by the trial, reaches 95%, but in its final evaluations it states verbatim that ""At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person, namely: ""
2) AIFA, in the faq n. 31 of its official website, it is not known on the basis of what data other than those provided by the FDA, reduces the percentage of effectiveness to just over 90%, but admits in turn that ""a portion of vaccinated people will not develop the immune defense "", And above all that"" we still do not know definitively if vaccination only prevents the manifestation of the disease or even the transmission of the infection "".
3) The New England Journal of Medicine, in an article written by the leading scientists, entitled ""Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine"", states that ""few participants in both groups had adverse reactions that led to withdrawal from the trial. No deaths were considered by investigators to be vaccine-related or placebo-related. No deaths associated with Covid-19 were observed. No stopping rules were met during the reporting period. Safety monitoring will continue for 2 years after the administration of the second dose of vaccine ""Regardless of the general insignificance of the whole, we still acknowledge that there are no people who died of placebo: it is already something.
In practice, despite the alleged effectiveness between 90% and 95%, for now we are dealing with a vaccine conceived as follows:
a) it is not known ""definitively"" whether the vaccine prevents the manifestation of the disease.
b) it is not known whether and for how long it provides protection;
c) it is not known whether it can prevent the transmission of the virus from person to person;
d) it is already well known that it will not be able to immunize all vaccinated subjects;",2020-12-31T11:24:38Z,gianni paladini,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTaOFF9_L_Cp4YIWJCFhcYTlPsNyXPKHhLDfw=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

We did not have lockdowns, hell, we barely even had what is called a quarantine, and that is mostly due to the fact that people were given the choice of starving to death, or going out to make money at the risk of contracting Covid-19. A huge portion of the population also believed that Covid-19 wasn't real and was just political. Where I'm trying to get is, I think that Brazil reported more cases of contraction than the UK because those who got it, and that includes the ones who got the placebo, probably thought they were 100% immune and didn't take care of themselves at all after getting it, not to mention asymptomatic cases, oh and it's not like they did take care beforehand anyways. I'm saying this, of course, considering that even after taking the vaccine, the the majority of the UK didn't just go out to the streets not wearing masks and licking rails. Btw even our god damn president mocks about the whole situation. Meanwhile the europeans had more respect for the pandemic, hence wearing masks, isolating, and not partaking in aglomerations, which I think is the reason that there was a huge difference in those tests, not just the fact that they took a different doses of the vaccine.",2020-12-30T22:49:57Z,Stardust,https://yt3.ggpht.com/96FTVPPV2XXuMJF54tZS7Gi8RC3XiekGwG3A5ZgaEGcqou2LzTcLPGr_xg6cEhdStIanCLm1x-0=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

One of the basic human rights is ""informed consent"" and the ""freedom and right to refuse a medical intervention."" The reason for that is because of what happened in Nazi Germany.
People are OK with the vaccine, as long as the right to refuse is in place.
People become suspicious when they hear politicians talk about ""mandated vaccines.""
That is when conspiracy theories start to take root.
It is very concerning when the medical profession appears to be in cahoots with politicians.
The basic principle of a medical professional is ""first do no harm.""
All medical interventions have side-effects, some very minor and unnoticeable. This is weighed up against the benefit: e.g. that it is saving your life. When I was a child we were only vaccinated against polio, smallpox and pertussis - deadly diseases. So everybody got chickenpox, mumps and measles. My mother was a nurse before she married and when we got sick she made you very comfortable, and the doctor said: ""Let nature take its course."" Medication, like antibiotics, were only given to save a life - not for sniffles.
Any vaccine has side effects, inevitably, but if there is a vaccine against ebola (20-80% fatality rate even as it infects young, healthy people) I will take it if I go to West Africa.
Taking a vaccine against a disease that is so mild, people have to be tested to know if they have it, and kills only elderly and sickly people seems silly, because the side-effects are bound to be as bad as getting the disease. (I am elderly, so I'm not being heartless - and I know of an elderly person - obese, bed-ridden and sickly, who got Covid and survived.)",2021-01-02T09:35:39Z,annatanneberger1,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQQcg3to7_cSvzZdJqEIBHDix8Tdr49G9nP=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

In the US, liability cases are trialed by a specialized court with specific rules on how to calculate damages. This was set up, I believe, to prevent that trial lawyers and the (rather) insane culture of litigation in the US end up bankrupting vaccine companies or force them to basically stop any R&D of vaccines. (I think it's the same story for liability of ski resorts). Regarding COVID19, US legislators provided companies with protection from liability to ensure that companies would accelerate their research and development efforts. It doesn't mean that they cut corners or that there's no recourse for patients who may suffer from a side effect, but only that trial lawyers (or the threat thereof) don't derail needed R&D efforts.

Different vaccines contain different ingredients that can include lab altered live or inactivated viruses and bacteria, chemicals, metals, proteins, antibiotics, neurotoxins and human, animal and insect DNA and RNA. Individual responses to vaccinations are based upon the weak genetic link in the person, but adverse reactions can always be linked directly to harm the bio-neurology from the introduction of neurotoxins to the bloodstream. Each person‚Äôs unique genetic makeup will respond to the neurotoxin with different physical symptoms that can be classified into a range of clinical diseases, but the attack against the brain, nervous system, DNA and mitochondria are increasingly evident in many vaccine injury cases.¬† Vaccinations tend to combine multiple metals in trace amounts, like aluminum and mercury, which exponentially increases its toxic impact to damage neurons and produce brain dysfunctions.¬†Additionally, live virus vaccines are grown on assorted human and animal cells collected from aborted fetal tissue, monkeys, cows, chickens, dogs, mice and other animals. The way many vaccines are produced is through cross-species viral contamination. When foreign DNA is injected into a human, the body‚Äôs immune response is to attack that foreign DNA. When that foreign animal DNA attaches to the human cells, the immune response includes attacking its own cells. Injecting these traces of multiple species DNA into the tissue and bloodstream also causes problems with DNA signaling in the body, with the human species original DNA. It is the confounding of human DNA language, designed to confuse communication in the cells. The human body cannot identify the original DNA signal when it becomes hybridized with multiple species, thus the cells are unable to recognize the frequency resonances of its true DNA parent.

Verily, I will mislead them, and surely, I will arouse in them false desires; and certainly, I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah.""

Some of them better than others. But I can say with total confidence that I have never EVER had some one explain these complicated topics in such a clear and efficient way. The content on this channel is without a doubt the best lecturing I have ever seen. I am 100% a visual learner. I need to be able to visualize something to understand it, which is very difficult when trying to learn processes that occur on microscopic levels. And yet these lectures do so in the best possible ways, better than any class I have taken. I cannot thank you enough for these videos and I hope that one day, when I have money I can give back to my community, I will be able to contribute some to Ninja Nerd Lectures. I'll probably start with the Patreon soon, because I can at least donate a dollar a month.

UgxmnbhUvdWqZ5eob094AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"Let me just recap this more simply - mRNA will transcribe onto your cells part of the genoma related to a protein unique to Covid-19. It will ""instruct"" your cells into producing it and that - in theory, but sadly there's not data on long term effects of this doing - should trigger the production of antibodies to fight it. Pity that because your own immune system will be creating that protein which your antibodies will then have to fight, it will be as if you had acquired an auto-immune disease. Your cells are not designed to produce any ""foreign"" protein, especially that of viruses. 

Just remember that to vaccinate you with these things they need your consent! They have NOT passed trial stage fully, hence why in UK they received an ""emergency"" use approval by the MHRA. Funnily enough, the MHRA is a technocratic organisation partly funded by... pharmas. Which have been granted immunity from liability from permanent vaccine damages. What a coincidence. Not. 
Lives are not commodities and experimentation on humans is forbidden by many an international law. 
These new ""vaccines"" are making commodities of your lives, but you can REFUSE to volunteer for the last trial. God knows what can happen to your immune system on the long run!!!

Can I ask how many lectures you have watched from the thousands of medical experts pleading with governments not to distribute this vaccine? If you'd want others to seek out a balanced opinion by watching this lecture then surely you'd seek out the opposing view too rather than belittling thousands with far more medical understanding than you to 'conspiracy theorist thinking the vaccines are full of nanotechnology that turn you into robots'. 
This was very affirming to me that we are indeed headed in the right direction towards finding an effective vaccine but, as we know, they can't be rushed. Might I recommend starting with any talk from Professor Dolores Cahill and seeing where that takes you. I'm afraid simply seeking out the information that we'd much rather be true is not a very scientific or safe approach when it comes to your health. BUT, if that is how you choose to go forward and have full faith that this vaccine is as safe and effective as we're told it is, then you can rest assured that someone who chooses not to have the vaccine will pose very little threat to you.

UgwCBge5D7Fk6mCTGzJ4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"Very good overview of the vaccine development process and the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines.  The data show that the vast majority of people do not need to get vaccinated.  
Consider the following:
(1)  The Moderna placebo or non-vaccinated control group data shows that only 1.2% will get sick without the vaccine and that only 0.07% will get severely sick.    
(2) The Pfizer/BioNTech placebo or non-vaccinated control group data shows that only 0.75% will get sick without the vaccine and that only 0.04% will get severely sick.    
(3)  The AstraZeneca study evaluated whether Covid-19 was present, not whether someone got sick from it.  We know that many people have no symptoms when Covid-19 is present.  Maybe that is why the efficacy rate of AstraZeneca is lower than the other vaccines.
(4)  We know only the extent and/or severity of some side effects from these vaccines ‚Äì sore injection site and flu-like symptoms.  After several people reported severe allergic reactions to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the FDA warns people with severe allergies not to take the vaccine.  Turns out Pfizer/BioNtech did not evaluate people with allergies in their analysis.  Who/what else was missed?
(5)  We know the demographic groups severely or adversely affected by Covid-19; namely those older than 75 and those with comorbidities. 
Conclusion ->  At present, only those older than 75 and those with comorbidities associated with Covid-19 should be vaccinated unless allergic to any components in the vaccine.  Those people who are often exposed to Covid-19, such as health care workers, should consider getting vaccinated as a precaution.  For all others, the vaccines have little if any benefit and it may be that the ‚Äúcure is worse than the bite‚Äù.",2020-12-21T19:06:39Z,R C,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT55MI2XG_OV8eiR875g6Vlm9bC8DorDkDHJA=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgzHbp8gMRM61DuObLN4AaABAg,0,35Idb_lCU4o,"A question for you @NinjaNerdsLectures

1.) How do Spike protein based antigens get placed on MHCII complexes in APCs? If the mRNA-LNP complex directly infects an APC (eg, a tissue resident macrophage or DC), then the Spike protein will be degraded in the cytosol, which is the MHCI pathway, not the MHCII pathway. As I understand it, MHCII pathways requires an *external* source of antigen, which because the Spike protein is anchored into the plasma membrane, there generally shouldn't be? 
2.) How do the Spike protein based antigens get presented to naive, resting B-cells in SLOs? As my textbooks have painted it, B-cells must be activated by natively folded antigen freely binding to BCRs. But given that the Spike is not secreted, how is the intact antigen presented to the B-cells?",2020-12-18T21:37:59Z,Ashwin Varma,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTSt67DsjG6AOOR27bGsH99_fE6AJdADYBW9w=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Just like you may need boosters, you shpuld get vaccinated when it's your turn (barring allergies or whatever) even if you've had covid because it seems that having the virus isn't giving people permanent immunity, just short term.

The reason there's no hiv vaccine is totally different than the barriers to developing a corona virus vax. Hiv uses a reverse transcriptase protein to synthesize it's genetic material. This is why it mutates very quickly, because reverse transcriptase makes many errors. Because it mutates so quickly, it's hard to develop a vaccine for. Also, we have really effective antiviral regimes so people can live long healthy lives and prevent transmission with HIV, so there's not as much demand for a vaccine as there is for covid.",2020-12-29T15:57:41Z,Kelsey Drifmeyer,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRJmOpZL3Ze1v2AUMk8wqvdm-FHX0MvszK1MA=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

I wanted to point out that you didn't mention the duration of the studies. I feel that time, as a variable, is as important as the number of participants; being effective for a few days/weeks is not a big achievement as it's going to cause a logistical nightmare. 

I also don't know how vaccines trials lack proper laboratory control settings; not being in control of the infection phase and relying on comparison with a placebo is mind-boggling, i.e,.leaving the most important variable (infection) to chance! Yes, placebo my cancel out this problem to an extent, but too much interpersonal behaviour/life  (mask-wearing, settings, infection of family members, working from home) variations that may alter the results of your study, even when you match your demographics as best as you can, it is really hard to rely on such data, especially if it's not given enough time to collect as much data as possible.",2020-12-17T00:20:49Z,Marwan,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQYd7q_F9fi7KKRzwT_2FKFBmBPfZjBtroXKX1qag=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

How is it/that (I assume you mean the vaccine) different than the actual virus‚Äôs actions? Well it is quite similar, and that‚Äôs kind of the genius of it. If a person were infected with the virus their cells would indeed be used to make more virus particles. The difference is that the mRNA contained in the vaccine only codes for the S protein, whereas the full blown virus uses our cells to make that protein and several other parts that can then assemble into complete virus particles - which can then go on to infect more cells, and so on, etc. So just stimulating our cells to make the spike protein is a great way to get antibodies made against the virus, while not having to actually have live virus running rampant inside us.

‚ÄúCan it mess up our own mRNA coding ribosomes?‚Äù Ribosomes read the mRNA code/message, and produce proteins from those instructions. The ribosomes will simply translate the mRNA like they would any other messages coming to them. I‚Äôm not 100% on the question here so I hope that answers it.

‚Äúcan it produce weird cytokines that cytotoxic T will overreact to?‚Äù The vaccine itself, the mRNA, does not produce cytokines, rather cytokines are released by the cells of our immune system under certain conditions. The term ‚Äúcytokine‚Äù is a very broad term covering a lot of different molecules, and undoubtably some will cytokine action will happen as a result of vaccination, however this is one of the pluses (and really the entire goal) of a vaccine - you get enough immune stimulation to produce antibodies, but not so much that you would get horribly sick like you would with regular infection, or suffer a ‚Äúcytokine storm‚Äù as we have heard about with COVID and which you may be referring to.

Your last question - ‚Äúcan a vaccinated person spread the virus?‚Äù a great one, and unfortunately no one knows just yet. I suppose until enough people are vaccinated that we can look at the numbers and evaluate if it has curbed the spread, we won‚Äôt know. That is what everyone is really really hoping for, but since it is not known yet, the current advice is to continue wearing a mask/distance/etc even after vaccination (for now). Bummer I know.

It's quite the process. Incidentally, on that same topic, biopharma stock trading is pretty much gambling unless the company is very well established with a number of already approved meds on the market generating revenue to keep them stable (and solvent) during their clinical trials of new meds. It's the smaller labs that carry the greater risk as they often have no previously approved medications on the market and rely on debt and investor cash infusions to keep them going. If they get a winner, their share price can increase many times over on the day of drug approval announcement. If they fail, or even hit some difficulties/delays in the process, you can see drops greater than 50% as investors instantly pull out.",2020-12-13T06:59:56Z,Stout Lager,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRiDS8rcrQuVMg9Rlsu47ZStbzBqKfTf-c1PiMv=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

It's in these secondary lymphoid organs where the APCs can activate the CD8+ T-cells. 

Your assumption: APCs get their Antigene handed over via blood stream, antigen derived from myocytes. This might be a very common assumption. 
In the first place, how do you know myocytes are transfected? Where is some empirical proof (you mention this up above)? 

Why not adhere to some opinion which holds APCs taking up nano lipds directly by endocytosis.

So, to answer a question I put above, assuming some presentation on myocyte is not folllowed up by killing by killer cells in the end, it ""depends on the question"" if presentation leads to cell death - not the apoptotic way - whether B cells take up such kind of debris on a regular basis. 
Highly interesting: yes indeed, myocytes or any other body cell might get transfected very fast by injection of nano lipes. As it sure is a common opinion that any cell can uptake lipids, which is astounding. So, I imagine the ""shoot"" of ""balls"" a very fast way to infect body cells which collide by presentation only - that's the hick - and B cells might thus act in a anti-inflammatory way! Only this morning I wondered why there are ""core"" antigens (Hepatitis B) that lead to antibodies. This only seems functional if there is some collapsing cells that spills out random debris of virus particels. B cells thus appear, to my mind, as just some other cleansers that clean up.
In other word, you will find ""proud presentation"" of immunization of t cells on Youtube. That is one thing. And I think the mechanism is direct uptake of nano lipids not even by membrane transport but endocytosis, by dendritic cells ""underneath the skin"". The other thing  me, I, learn to see is the b cells getting efficient food on, their b cell receptors, because body cells, yes, myocytes do collaps that fast that they do not even get killed in the regular apoptotic way by t killer cells. These might come up too slowly. However, that might be some regulare, ordinary mechanism, b cells get their antigens. Yes, of course: if you get symptoms, some t cell cytotoxixxs must have weighed in  - too late. That's the inflammatory b cell way, not the apoptotic t cell way. I think  I see the light.

Before having any effector functions, a naive CD8+ T-cell needs to be activated by an MHC I expressing cell which displays the (foreign viral) peptide in the MHC I complex. However, the CD8+ activation requires three steps which only a few cell types can provide. Otherwise the naive CD8+ T-cells could be activated by any viral or non-viral antigen in the MHC I complex by any nucleated cell. Just like the CD4+ T-cells the CD8+ T-cells require a costimulatory signal and cytokines for activation on top of recognizing the antigen with their TCR. The only cells which can provide all of these signals are APCs such as dendritic cells. In order for the CD8+ T-cell activation to happen at all an APC such as a dendritic cell itself needs to be infected by the virus or it can have endocytosed viral particles. The ability of some APCs to display extracellular peptides on the MHC I -complex is called cross-presentation. This ability to display exogenous peptides is _required_ in infections which do not target the APCs themselves and in vaccines for the CD8+ T-cell activation.

How I understand this right now is that the viral peptide, such as the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, is synthesized in the cells which the vaccines mRNA ends up transfecting. Since the vaccination is done i.m., the cells which get transfected are mainly myocytes and keratinocytes. They definitely display parts of the viral protein and its shorter peptides on their MHC I -complexes, but they lack the ability to provide necessary signals for the CD8+ T-cells to activate. So the initial MHC I complex presentation only inhibits NK cells and there are no cytotoxic T-cells which can recognize the new antigen in the MHC I: nothing happens. The viral S-protein has to travel to dendritic cells before any cytotoxic T-cells against it can be formed. The myocytes and keratinocytes will produce the S-protein to be secreted outside of the cell. If or when these proteins end up in the bloodstream, they will be recognized by the immune system (mainly by B-cells and dendritic cells in spleen, I'm guessing). It's also possible that the transfected cells go into apoptosis and the apoptotic bodies with the viral protein can be taken up by dendritic cells and these dendritic cells then travel to a nearby lymph node to display the foreign antigen. And I guess it's also possible for the cross presentation to start directly from transfected dendritic cells but if the vaccine is given by i.m., there shouldn't be any DCs to transfect. With intradermal vaccinations that pathway might work. 

Anyway, in order for the CD8+ T-cells to mature into cytotoxic T-cells, they need to be activated. Activation happens through interaction with an APC. The APC needs to have seen the viral antigen (S-protein) which is synthesized and secreted by myocytes or keratinocytes. It then needs to process it and display the viral peptide in its MHC I -complex, give a costimulatory signal (B7-family + CD28 -interaction) and secrete cytokines to naive CD8+ T-cell attached to it. To make this a little more complex, it seems that activated CD4+ Th2 cells are also important in the cross-presentation pathway by secreting IL-2 and IFN-Œ≥ to the CD8+ -cell as well as somehow activating or helping the dendritic cells with cross-presenting.

From what I was able to gather this pathway of activation and the subsequent clonal expansion of the effector T-cells from the introduction of viral antigens takes days, even a week depending on the stimulus. The mRNA is very transient as the RNA gets degraded quickly after translation. How long this takes exactly with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was unknown but protein synthesis tends to be over in a couple of hours. With a large amount of viral mRNA introduced that might take a bit longer. Hard to say exactly.

Going back to your original question: they should be. However, before any effector cells can be created after the antigen is introduced for the first time, the protein synthesis and most likely the MHC I -complex with a viral peptide attached should be long gone from the myocytes and keratinocytes. However, things might be different if the viral material was introduced again with the same method. In the future, the immune system has the ability to recognize the antigen since the once activated CD8+ cells transform into T-memory cells after the contraction. Transfecting your own cells with viral mRNA again might lead to a very different response. They will present the peptide in the MHC I -complex and they should be destroyed by the cytotoxic T-cells. As for how important this effect is I couldn't say. I didn't bother to look it up either.",2020-12-11T15:34:24Z,Sorwis,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTWDqa3e8f2tCiN7NYQntJgJxoUy0WUFaJMVohs=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

What I find the most troubling is the fact that you claim to be a future doctor and want to have ""all the information out there in the public - good or bad"" yet decide to spread vague information (possibly even mis- or disinformation) about two individual cases of nonspecific injury on YouTube comment section of a perfectly neutral representation of the vaccines' mechanisms. That is an antithesis of what you preach. It causes distrust towards medicine as a whole and quickly undermines the work of many professionals who try to communicate openly. It takes next to no effort to make claims but it takes an enormous amount of work to fact check them and even more to correct wrong or otherwise bad information.

A great amount of anti-vaccination movement or milder forms of it like vaccine hesitancy is ultimately derived from pure ignorance. There's no shame in that as this is a vast and difficult subject. However it would be greatly appreciated if people would realize when the subject is out of their scope and resort to the experts on information. Videos like these help to communicate rather complex health related concepts to people who are interested. This video and channel is of course aimed to people who already have solid understanding and interest of the workings of human body and not to the general public. This kind of information has to be communicated because the scientific literature and especially studies are much harder and slower to digest. For medicine to opt out from massively influential ways of communication on the internet would be irresponsible. People's desire for information in a rapidly changing situation with a lot of unknown factors is one element which keeps on driving the wild theories and skepticism, both unfounded and not. What we really need is more evidence based information which is concise and understandable for everyone and which keeps getting updated. I think we also need someone to shoot down and fact check the most common misconceptions and misinformation.

I wrote a reply of over 12 000 characters but apparently YouTube doesn't allow for it to be posted in its entirety. Here's an excerpt...

People need to realize is that there's nothing absolute in medicine or in life. Medical science is not an exact science like physics. There's no vaccine, medication, treatment or a way of life which is completely safe. We can never know how things are going to be but we have a tool to make sure that these things we produce to cure diseases are as safe and effective as possible: the scientific method and rigorous research. I want to emphasize that safety is the primary subject of study in drug development throughout phases 1, 2 and 3.

Getting a therapy is all about the risks of the disease we are trying to cure and the risks and benefits of the treatment for it. As you probably understand, no healthy person will receive chemotherapy as it's damaging to the body but that therapy might save a cancer patient's life since the risks involved have shifted: the cancer is a much greater threat than the therapy for it. A surgeon might not operate on a patient because the risks involved with the surgery are considerable compared to the possible benefits expected from it. You and I probably go out in the winter and risk getting frozen to death each time. Same applies to when you are crossing the road, driving a car on a highway, eating various unprepared foods etc. yet are probably completely unconcerned and even ignorant of the risks involved in our daily activities that you don't even consider them risks. You probably also instinctively adapt and reduce risks in these activities. You put on warmer clothes during cold weather, look both ways and wear something reflective while crossing the road, wear a seatbelt, drive a safe car, don't drive under the influence and adhere to the rules of the road while you drive as well as look, smell, rinse and taste the food you put into your mouth. Same goes for almost all over the counter medications and supplements we take: they all have a plethora of health risks involved but people rarely tend to consider them. People often tend to think these ordinary things are safe and in most cases they would be right. They are relatively safe. It's not likely that you will get injured or even die on a highway accident. However when you compare the risks of driving on a highway to risks of taking a vaccine, there's absolutely no comparison on which is the most dangerous thing to do. Compared to vaccination, not vaccinating yourself could be seen as a risky behavior in most situations.

Living with risks and uncertainty is the nature of our lives whether you are aware of them or not. Only talking about risks is not of use to anybody. Realizing that there's risks involved in everything and medicine tends to take it very seriously by researching and reporting them openly. In the case of contagious diseases the assessment of risks and benefits involved extends further to involve people around us. In order to properly assess the safety of a therapy you need research and perspective which only tends to come with expertise. Being a medical student like you claim to be or as I am doesn't necessarily mean you have expertise on a specific health related subject. It does, however, put you into a special position in society where what you say will always be heard as words of a (future) professional and such it bears great responsibility on your actions. Being a nurse generally does not mean you have any expertise on medical science. I say this with pure respect for their essential work. And being a doctor doesn't either. Being a someone who specializes in this field of medicine is someone to listen to. There are thousands of experts who have dedicated their lives for research of contagious diseases, vaccines, viruses, immunology, epidemiology etc. Just like you will consult a fellow physician for a treatment option, you should listen to the true medical experts of this field, stay humble, open and understand your responsibilities.",2020-12-11T12:21:15Z,Sorwis,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTWDqa3e8f2tCiN7NYQntJgJxoUy0WUFaJMVohs=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Looking at the history of medicine, future trials, the impact on health. Daily. This is why I come to this channel. Its is everybody's right to ask questions. I would like to know where you have collected your research from? 
It feels like you have an objective is emotional coercion, if the information is proved solid again and again and again there should be no problems? Such an easy fall back to bring in 'anti-vax' because it has negative connotation. People have a right to know what is going inside their body or their child's body. It's a medic role to know this. Its wrong to try and shut some one down for not agreeing WITH your insistence. We learn by keeping our minds open and listening to each other, no shouting each other down by saying I am right and you are wrong.  What I was saying in light of the medic was not to sound superior, I am sorry you heard it that way, it was purely for the basis of research. You are correct about the risk, so what is the problem with discussing them openly? If there is risk there, why is there not more investigation to remove it? What can we do to make this more safe? I was saying that publishing about the vaccine was too soon as clinical trials have not finished yet? which is a fact. Just like thousands of other as you mention I also plan to dedicated my life to ensuring people health. I never claimed any medical experience just yet? As for medical experts in the field, I choose to listen to Dr Mike Yeadon, Dr  Vernon Coleman, Lynn Redwood RN, Dr Wolfgang Wodrg, Dr Supta Gupta.

Cytokine cascades have innate negative feedback loops. Some interleukins are naturally anti-inflammatory and stimulate the anti-inflammatory Treg cells, for example. The receptor binding in a target cell tends to lead into a downregulation of the signaling pathway within the cell which it just activated and so on. Of course, in the case of COVID-19, some of the most severe cases are caused by cytokine storm where the system is out of balance for some reason. I'm not going to speculate on the specific mechanisms why that happens to some people.

> how do the T cytotoxic cells know NOT to ""destroy"" the host cells?

Cytotoxic T-cells need to be activated by APCs by the specific antigen before they have any effector functions on cells presenting viral peptides on the MHC I -complexes. Before they are activated, they do nothing. And they can only be activated via a regulated mechanism through APCs which have met the same antigen before them. So basically you first need to get the antigen into APCs which then can activate the naive CD8+ T-cells. This takes some time, days to even a week. During this time the CD8+ T-cell matures into a cytotoxic T-cell and proliferates. After that it can attack against any cell presenting that specific viral peptide on their MHC I -complex. I would assume that this MHC I complex peptide presentation is long gone with the myocytes and keratinocytes which get transfected by viral mRNA in i.m. vaccination by the time the CD8+ T-cells have matured and proliferated. On a second encounter? They should attack faster. How exactly this works with the vaccines I have no idea (say, you get another shot of this sort of vaccine). I have no idea if it has any relevance in practice even if the idea of your muscle cells going into apoptosis due to viral peptides being synthesized and cytotoxic T-cells attacking them might sound very serious on paper. Then again, some cells are always bound to die if you stick needles and inject milliliters of anything into them. Perhaps someone has good information on this but I'm too lazy to fact check on that right now.

I don't know if this answered your questions. Many of the actual clinical questions you have remain unanswered. Or perhaps there are answers already but I just haven't come across them yet. I don't think there's much to be worried about the safety but there certainly are a lot of things we don't know which mainly affect how effective the vaccines are at controlling the disease. So far, on what has been published, it looks promising.",2020-12-11T18:44:50Z,Sorwis,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTWDqa3e8f2tCiN7NYQntJgJxoUy0WUFaJMVohs=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

 -The absolute Only thing that anyone should be paying attention to in all this chaos and hysteria, are the excess deaths and overall mortality numbers. They have remained remarkably and starkingly consistent with other normal years. That is how anyone with any critical thought process, understand something smells beyond logic and fathom.   

-Calculate the total sum of excess deaths, then subtract normal annual natural mortality and the mass increase in death by suicides, and then account for the uptick surge in deaths caused by   cancellations and suspensions  of (The) number one life saving mitigation in the world, ( Early Detection cancer, heart attack and stroke). Equates to the actual death rate from SARS-COV-2, to be almost nullified in the data. 

-  In other words, if it wasn't for the mitigation attempts of lock-down  and the collapse of a globally dependent economy, the excess deaths and overall mortality right now, would be  on par with any other year.

-What is going on right now, is what is known in epidemiology as the pathogen endemic equilibrium phase of the pandemic (viral stasis) The absolute only reason case numbers are so high, is because the PCR mass testing is overwhelmingly false positive and the rest, are picking up old fragmented Corona virus protein parts in the throat/nasal swab. This has zero to do with being in danger or having any active infection whatsoever. 

-T-Cell immunity always has given us long term immunity. Even though SARS-COV-2 is considered a novel virus, all Corona viruses are genetically sequenced very similarly and are riddled with the same hijacked and borrowed protein and molecular parts. T-Cells recognize these attached protein markers on every covid 19 invading virus through a long term recall memory, recognition and RNA transcription mechanism (cross immunity). The T-cells rapidly shred the viruses into fragments as they enter the body, and store them away for future recognition inside our bone marrow and other tissue. This is precisely why for the vast majority of the time the infections are very mild or completely benign.",2020-12-09T04:10:16Z,Ghwk-phd,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRMSWY1lDbPqY2ndjrC-1Msm2ZjQi2Gha9tnA=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Vaccines were designed in the image of piercing snake fangs delivering poisonous venom to the whole world? ü§î And we know that serpents are cold blooded, double-tongued experts of deception. Also ironic that two doses of the vaccine are required considering the serpents two fangs.

Does anyone know if people from these communities were part of the trials and if so what proportion of the participants? Only asking because it might have a bearing on the efficacy of the vaccine trials. The only problem with these vaccines is that no one knows if there are any long term side effects.

3. Pfizer did not assess vaccine reactions in all 43,000 participants (just a random subset of 8000)
4. Pfizer only reported sever reactions that occurred in more than 2% (860 people). In other words, if 800 people suffered a sever immune reaction, they did not have to report it because it occurred in less than 2%!!

2. Same goes to the time passed from phase 3. Usually we have years ahead of us. How can we garante that no dangers are to arise later on including on the people who were the volunteers to be included in the clinical trials?

Considering that Aztrazeneca was actually swabbing the participants, rather than counting participants with symptoms, wouldn't it make sense for them to show a higher proportion of positives (for they would also include the asymptomatic participants), and therefore show a lower efficacy?
Or was the 70% also evaluated by counting symptomatic participants, rather than PCR positive ones?

I also compare this situation to updates for my phone. A lot of the time after I‚Äôve updated the phone has glitches/ problems. The second update fixes those problems.
The movie I Am Legend (where they vaccinated people with their cancer vaccine that was 100% effective) immediately came into mind.
I‚Äôd like to see what happens to people that want it over a five year period of time but I‚Äôm afraid that being in the healthcare field, I will be mandated (forced) to take it. I‚Äôve been in healthcare for 20 years and will probably have to make a very difficult decision.

You know how we conduct research, and are aware of differences between feelings/intuition/anecdotal evidence/movies etc., versus clinical trials and case-control studies of varying types. It might be good to remind oneself of the immense undertakings and background required for doing research once in a while, as it is sometimes easy to forget.

Concern is fine. That is why we do research. But saying the CDC and the FDA would be forced to overlook things because there is a pharmaceutical tie to both agencies, can only be applied by personal mistrust in those specific organisations, because it absolutely doesn't match with the intentions of either agency, the people they employ, the history of either agencies performance, nor the scientific methods they subscribe to.

Either way, I'm glad you have come here out of concern. I have too, and Ninja Nerd science is (in my opinion) definitely one of the best youtube-based informational channels to answer these questions in a concise manner, for those of us who don't have the time to study the years it takes to understand even the simpler concepts of virology/epidemiology.
