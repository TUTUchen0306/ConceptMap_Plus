PLEASE NOTE: Dr. Seheult says in this video “I can’t tell you how much vitamin D to take because I’m not your doctor nor am I here to give you medical advice.” As always, there may be risks with any supplement or medication, and a variety of individual factors (patient weight, underlying medical conditions, sunlight exposure, other vitamins that may enhance the impact of vitamin D etc.) should all be considered.  We always recommend speaking with your individual medical professional before making changes to your vitamins or medications.  Thank you for watching and for your comments!

I must stress though that I am in no way a dr and I respect people’s choices. These ideas all bought about fear and confusion, so we trusted what we were told.

Ugzds5BnaYpCstEcevV4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"I've been watching your videos since I first heard about the coronavirus on January 28th, 2020. That date will forever be etched in my mind. I just came out of seeing my primary care doctor, heard it on the radio, pulled over and listened to the entire broadcast. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. At that time the narrative was that the virus was transmitted from a ""wet market"" in Wuhan, China, but I had a gut feeling something was amiss. Shortly after, I brought a food / glove/mask/  ""prepper"" box over to my son and family. They looked at me weirdly and thought I was kind of crazy, but accepted the box anyway.  I told them this is going to get bad... Then what was it, a few weeks later? When it was officially announced as a worldwide pandemic, they then said, I guess you're not so crazy after all Mom!  I diligently listened to and read everything I could get my hands on but you and the British doctor I can't remember what his name is, Cramer perhaps? Were my go-to podcasts first thing, the national and worldwide news next. I must say, I became a little obsessed and have had to back off.

Now, my focus is on researching the vaccines. I am 71, a light to moderate smoker of natural products--cigarillos to be specific (wow, do you think my smoking in addition to my rigorous attempts to disinfect everything and follow covid protocol has kept me safe so far?) Something certainly has kept my family safe and I wasn't willing to abandon my relationship with my grandchildren. Since I live only a mile away and was there or them here several times a week, my rationale was that we kind of lived in the same household haha! Bottom line, however, it has been by the grace of God that we are all well!
 
I'm waiting for the Covaxxin vaccine from India in partnership with a university here in the states to be made available in America. For me, old school vaccines where one is injected with a milder/deadened form of the disease makes more sense. I get a flu shot every year, but not the high-powered one, have had my shingles shot and the Prevnar pneumonia shot. I'll fly to wherever I have to, to receive the Covaxxin. Your thoughts?...

I appreciate all you do, just getting around to watching this video about vitamin D. I found it extremely informative--especially the statistics and graphs you provide. I also have been taking 2000 mg of Vit D daily for 5 years now in addition to a calcium magnesium and zinc supplement--doctors' ""orders"".🙂

Tumeric (w/ pepper for absorption). I had it in my system for 4 years for joint pain (works). Curcumin has been shown to be a major antiviral that inhibits the ZIKA virus and lessens the effect of the HIV virus...

     Look up this article: Curcumin inhibits Zika and chikungunya virus infection by inhibiting cell binding:
       "" Previously, curcumin exhibited antiviral properties against several viruses, including dengue virus and hepatitis C virus, among others. Here, we describe the antiviral effect of curcumin on Zika and chikungunya viruses, two mosquito-borne outbreak viruses. Both viruses responded to treatment of cells with up to 5 μM curumin without impacting cellular viability. We observed that direct treatment of virus with curcumin reduced infectivity of virus in a dose- and time-dependent manner for these enveloped viruses, as well as vesicular stomatitis virus.""

UgwCoFInlttdk9fNmg14AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"Dear Docs. Clearly, supplementing with vitamin D and/ or eating more high vitamin D foods is very important - not just to prevent/ heal from respiratory illnesses, but to prevent breast cancer and more. However, as far as supplementation goes, I have read from other sources that without enough vitamin K2 in the system, to ""balance"" the vitamin D supplementation, somehow the vitamin D can cause calcium to go into the soft tissues of the body - joints, etc. - instead of into the bones. (I looked at a couple of the excerpts you included that mentioned ""hypercalcemia"". One of them mentioned this could cause excess calcium in the blood, kidney stones, etc....) My other reading also said that K2, taken as a supplement  - or (better yet, I think) as eaten from high K2 foods (such as fermented vegetables, milk kefir, and Swiss, Gouda, or other natural cheeses) - somehow ""ushers"" calcium into the bones, instead of the soft tissues, while people are doing the healthy thing of supplementing with vitamin D. I understand that the trick is to get enough K2 at the same time as taking vitamin D. i would really love to find more info on how and why K2 does this - how vitamin D and K2 partner together to ""do the right thing"" and get calcium into the bones. I would really like to know what is likely to work, vs. what might be less-than optimal/ alright this way. (P.S. I am a long-term lacto-ovo vegetarian. Vitamin D supplements made of fish are gross to me. The ones made of lanolin from sheep wool are less gross to me, but made me feel queasy/ not good. I am now happy with vitamin D supplement drops derived from an algae. I try to get significant natural cheese and/or kimchi in a day, to provide vitamin K2, to try to balance the vitamin D drops, which are 1000mg a drop.)

UgzGmDgtGp4lO6X33cJ4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"Might there be a role for short-term use of nicotine patches, in the treatment of patients with vascular disease who contract CoVID-19? They'd get the anti-inflammatory and vasodilation benefits of nicotine, without having to smoke it. The New York Post reported in an article dated today, 12 Feb 2021, the case of an Italian woman with CoVID-19, who developed blood clots secondary to the thrombogenic effects of SARS-CoV-2. She went on to develop gangrene in her fingers, and 3 of which had to be amputated. Her case was novel enough and shocking enough to be written up in the European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery. In such a patient, the judicious use of a nicotine patch seems warranted, absent contraindications to such a therapy. It's something to think about. Here's a link to the NY Post article I cited.

While family and friends miss work and are down with a cold or other illnesses (fever, flu, headaches, upset stomach, etc) periodically throughout the year, for years I  have never been stuck at home in bed and missing out on anything because of being sick. Instead, I have enjoyed consistent great health without interruption for 8 years in a row. This doctor is point on - it IS vitamin D ( vitamin D3 specifically) that protects you from contagious illnesses of the cold and flu types. I had been getting my vitamin D3 from hours and hours of sunlight each day/week in the warmer seasons while working outside, which would tide me over throughout the winter. So, it makes sense that the immune system would be strong enough to either protect one from covid 19 entirely, or at least cause one to recover very quickly and without a serious case of it.

UgzscK8AlMMVv5W0Vo54AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"Just a comment on 25:00 starting with the school children. To me, this looks like a simple two-way contingency table analysis or just the ordinary logistic. So basically you can calculate the odds ratio, and use the chi-square test. This will be even more informative than just directly compare the percentages. so the odds of the placebo is rough 18.6/81.4=22.85%, and for vitamin D, it's 10.8/89.2=12.11%. The odds ratio is 0.53, which is more informative than the 0.58=10.8/18.6. Simply looking at the odds ratio, we may conclude you will be half likely to get the flu if you take vitamin D3, the ""likelihood"" is 0.47 times less compared to those not getting it.",2021-01-05T03:13:30Z,Abc Def,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSuwmsh5pszLeeY4-TNkbokP8PlEymdcaw-fg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

You appear to have selected a number of studies backing your hypothesis. A cursory academic search reveals many more studies that show no association. I think you only mentioned one? Also, you did not mention a mechanism of action. How does Vitamin D interact with the immune system to help ward off CoVid-19? You appear to have provided a general idea that the immune system (and many either cell types) need Vitamin D, but you did not explain in what way biochemically this helps in any detail. Is there any direct impact on the ACE receptors themselves and/or the antigens? Is there an intracellular biochemical mechanism that is blocking transcription? How so? What is happening there?

UgxftTtVY-Tv49o2K5t4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"The evidence is very suggestive, but I am bothered by the lack of attention to socioeconomic factors that we know to be co-variant with race and ethnicity and, one might surmise, also with Vitamin D levels and COVID risk. The chart in lower left at 36.49 is a case in point. Here it is shown that for each race separately, positive rates of COVID tests are correlated with decreasing D levels in the blood. And yet, the variation across the entire spectrum of D level for whites is smaller than the variation for the other races, and even at the lowest D level, whites are less likely to test positive than Blacks or Hispanics at the higher D levels. This finding is consistent with the notion that general levels of nutrition and health, which are lower among Blacks than among whites, as well as the fact that lower-income people tend to live in closer quarters with others and work in jobs (waiting tables, driving taxis, etc.) where they come into contact with many more people, are at least as important as D levels alone in explaining these patterns. Indeed, one could speculate that the higher rates of test positivity for whites with Vitamin D deficiency compared to whites with good D levels, could be entirely explained by poor nutrition and general health (which make them more susceptible to infection) and low income (resulting in more frequent contact with other people who might be infected) for that cohort, rather than by D levels alone.

UgwHs4zSsEuRslYuoQB4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"Thank you for a very informative video. I take vitamin D3 supplementation at 1000 iu (25ug) level, but I also take vitamin K at 4000 iu (100ug). Leading up to the xmas period I caught a heavy cold and isolated myself for a week, because I wasn't sure if it was a mild case of Covid-19, and also, my work colleagues were somewhat fearful of working with me. On the fifth day of the illness I had a Covid-19 swab test done, and it came back negative. I did not have Covid.

I am nearing my 61st year, and I am a smoker, and the upshot is that the cold lead to a chest infection, but I already had antibiotics so I took them. As of the time of writing this, I am much better and very ready to go back to work on Monday the 4th January. I am classed as an essential worker and have worked all the through the viral pandemic. I only started taking vitamin D3 and vitamin K supplements about 6 weeks ago. I live in the North West of England, so I am way above the 35th parallel. If there's one thing this video showed and clearly imports from all the studies presented is that vitamin D3 supplementation does help to control Covid-19 infection and symptoms if infected.

It also showed that vitamin D3 can end up being stored in fat tissue and I should imagine that this source of vitamin D3 can only become available to the body during fat-burning exercise? Vitamin D3 in the blood will be the first of the resource used, and so levels of it in the blood will go up and down. I should also think that in the blood is where you want vitamin D3 to be so that it can be used by the body. This is one reason why I take vitamin K, because vitamin K helps to place vitamin D3 in the areas where the body needs it (how true this I cannot say).

One aspect of the video that truly informed me was to learn that vitamin D3 is actually a hormone, and can play a part in the transcription phase within the cell, which places an entirely different perspective upon it. It made me think of vitamin D3 as an essential ingredient towards having a working and an effective immune system, possibly involved in the making of the natural killer cells which deal with cells infected by a virus?",2021-01-01T01:23:48Z,Elysiumfire,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRcjWnvcePm2G1biFOfz-fx-3XYNqXoOaiWjnDW=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

 When reading about the vaccine from before, I understand that the vaccine as a part of the process, will start the production of T-cells! I also have read that T-cells need vitamine D to be activated. Is this also the case with vaccines? 

 
Is it correct to assume that if this is the case, older people who mostly have a low vitamine D rate, will have less effect from vaccines? 
 
50% of the population in the world suffer from low rate of vitamine D, so the vaccine will not have the desired effect on this part of the population? 
 
In the video it is reffered to postive Covid 19 cases, so I wonder which tests are these statistics based on? We all now by now that PCR test are not to be trusted as a diagnostic tool……??.

Now, people drink energy drinks and eat fast food , junk food. We are basically dying due to the corporate driven disintegration of the family and the invasion of corporate poison food in our lives. When I was growing up, people might eat a slice of pizza twice per year. Now it seems like a daily greasy salty  mess for many! The Covid pandemic will be tamed and still 75% of American citizens will be either overweight or obese.

UgzdKkuold2cB5ZYz0t4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"Good video. Thank you. I personally think Vitamin D is very underrated. People say you should get it from the sun, but from my experience it is hard to do that. Most people (especially in Australia where I am) slather on sunscreen lotion or cover up before leaving the house. I work in an office and therefore am inside most of the day. I started supplementing with Vitamin D3 (along with fish oil that also contains Vit D) in 2008 as an experiment for treating psoriasis and found it to be extremely helpful (of course nobody believed me!). Since then I have taken it most winters in an effort to ward off flu and it has worked quite well. Back in March when Covid kicked off, I read in the media that supplements would NOT help in the slightest and don't bother wasting your money on them.....so I disregarded that and  increased my daily dosage of Vitamin D3. I have also had to work throughout lockdown and traveled on public transport without a mask in the early days and with a mask thereafter. Not had any flu symptoms this past winter at all. Had my first Covid test yesterday  - not sick but has been a outbreak in my area and officals want everyone tested. The fact that I have remained well all winter during this Covid season, I contribute to the Vitamin D3 (along with zinc) that I have been taking daily all that time. Sadly anyone I have suggested this to, has pretty much poo-pooed that idea and called me an idiot for thinking that way......so I hope this video turns out to be 100% correct.",2020-12-18T20:05:42Z,MrsSlocombes PuddyCat,https://yt3.ggpht.com/XpgU1E16EymNbRyCMR7OweCceVFa_eakEYu7B8sesEeLxf1Zqk6M_4M4Efg1J19fHHxfY6J9nA=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

It is clear your converance with medicalese, and it is also clear that your intentions are very pure... But inevitably, as with people who invest their lives in such studies, the nerd aspect overcomes the intention aspect, and we wind up swimming in a morass of almost meaningless data because you figure, incorrectly, that the minds of your listeners can easily wrap themselves around such arcane concepts once you explain them clearly. But it would be much like myself, a musician, telling you about the profundities of musical theory and the incredible diversity involved in that medium, and informing you in a matter of several minutes, of all the tools and computational skills that will enable you to eventually master such a command... But nevertheless, you will have been hopelessly lost not too far into my presentation because your brain is simply not user-friendly with such nomenclature and numerology.

if you really want to help human beings, ordinary mortals with lives to live and with no consuming passion about vitamin d and its subterranean aspects, then you will need to remake this video or seriously edit it, so that these people can keep track of where you are and make sense at their own level of what you're trying to say.

Until then, you will lose many many potential friends and listeners, and they will go away compromised in their understanding as a result.

UgyttpXR6Hya8qwC-y54AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"The WORST part is, not only are they (purposely?) NOT telling us about the link with Vitamin D (and how older people have a harder time producing it naturally AND absorbing it from manufactured vitamins), but that they are telling us to STAY INDOORS!!  We get MOST of our D from the SUN and if we're indoors, we're not 'making' the V-D ourselves... Go figure... 

At the same time, they are telling us to all wear masks, but the have lessened up on the other things we ALSO need to do:
WASHING YOUR HANDS PROPERLY AND OFTEN!!  In the beginning, we were all told this over and over and and guess what, people learned the proper way AND DID IT!  What happened?  Virus stopped spreading so quickly.
CLEAN AND DISINFECT YOUR HOME AS WELL AS WORKPLACE!!  Remember how all the stores ran out of cleaners?  Well, there's plenty now, but people aren't cleaning their OWN (homes) doorknobs, faucet handles, keyboards, remotes, mice, phones, etc.  So, when someone goes out and picks up the virus and then brings it home, they give it to everyone OR even just to themselves.  Virus is on their hands, but can't get in through skin, but people touch their faces, ears, eyes, nose, mouth MUCH MORE at HOME and if they already have put the virus on everything, but don't clean it, it waits.
CLOTH MASKS DON'T PREVENT YOU FROM GETTING THE VIRUS! - Look at the CDC site, it will tell you to wear one to prevent YOU from infecting OTHERS.  But you are still able to breathe in the virus from most cloth masks and especially if they are not TIGHTLY FITTED (which hardly anyone does)

So, why does the news and the politicians want us to NOT get our vitamin D (from sunlight) or other anti-oxidents and things that will BUILD OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM??  Instead, it seems they are doing just the opposite - letting people's immune systems 'weaken' because all we're doing is saying ""Wear a mask, wear a mask""  tell me, where are the stats that tell us how many people WERE WEARING MASKS but got the virus anyway??  Yeah, they are not publishing that, are they?

I started those supplements as a means to battle chronic depression but soon discovered the benefits of D3 as an immunity booster. Even before I started on the Vitamin D3, I was taking 1600 IU of Folic Acid as a replacement for eating 7x more leafy greens as my cardiologist had recommended in 2004 because of my high LDL levels. The Folic Acid did the trick and my levels went from 250mg/dL to 90mg/dL and have remained there. Folic Acid also carries immunity-boosting benefits as well as the D3. I was virtually never sick. And when I did happen to get a cold or flu, (maybe 4-6 times in 16 years) its duration was less than 3 days. I found Dr. Seheult's presentation very compelling.

UgyzcK3zs-kTNX0pZCt4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"So much misery could have been avoided if people had known all this a year ago! In a world where a vaccine full of toxins is considered our savior, and a lock down to supposedly ""stop infection"" is impoverishing the majority of families, many to the point of losing the roof over their heads, and closing businesses, bankrupting local and state governments and leading our national government to print money that is causing trillions in debt to Wall Street, sufficient vitamin D for everyone would have PREVENTED THE PANDEMIC IN THE FIRST PLACE, or would have stopped COVID in its tracks in the second place. 

Just think of how different things would be right now if Americans had known about vitamin D! First, it would have prevented the heart-rending death toll, which was made even worse because these failing patients were separated from loved ones at the end while being treated with procedures that can’t compensate for D deficiency. All those families lost loved ones for no reason at all. 

Secondly, we’d have normal lives, kids wouldn’t be isolated from friends, stuck on screens for hours each day, losing educational ground. Adults wouldn’t be scared of every little cough in their vicinity, and we would be adding to the well-being of our communities instead of hiding at home.

The only losers from the nation knowing the benefits of adequate vitamin D would be, ta dah, Pharma!

Back in the 30s and 40s the FDA advised mothers to feed their children cod liver oil, which had A, D, and DHA-EPA, so kids were healthy. (Now they remove the A and D before bottling it up as a fish oil food supplement.) But now the FDA is just the cheerleader for high-profit, zero-liability vaccines.

It's a crime against humanity to push the vaccines so strongly while ignoring Mother Nature's time-testing ways of preventing pandemics. The current CDC is nothing but a branch office of Pharma and Dr. Fauci (who takes 1000 IU of vitamin D every day https://bgr.com/2020/09/28/coronavirus-treatment-vitamin-d-anthony-fauci-recommendation/, along with 1000 mg of C) should be prosecuted for not making vitamin D (and zinc, and the essential fatty acids of DHA and EPA, and vitamin C) the focus of a successful response to COVID-19.",2020-12-18T16:24:59Z,Lauren Ayers,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRzwYbMl3BObFHy6ZzrjP5cDcTTWd5EQomtZg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgzY1I_Lf9tmA38RHXJ4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"We are offered a lecture on Vitamin D as ""therapeutic agent""? From a professor-student of ""medicine"".
Well, studying medicine, a professor in medicine explained to me, can exclude studying biology, microbiology, chemistry, biochemistry, etc.
From biology and biochemistry (see the metabolic pathways posters [ http://biochemical-pathways.com/#/map/1 ]) we can learn that protein synthesis depends on availability of vitamin D and zinc. We also know that the immune system heavily depends on protein synthesis.
If we have deficiencies in either then we have problems keeping our immune system working properly or keeping our skeleton being updated or to grow hair and nails. These all depend on protein synthesis.
How our bodies balance deficiency out between these, in what order, may have a genetic aspect.
If your food is not varied enough and you miss out on vitamin D and zinc, you will suffer the consequences.
Like oxygen, vitamin D is not a medicine. We need to keep breathing. We need to eat or make enough vitamin D. This also applies to zinc. Just note that with taking zinc supplements you need to take balanced trace amounts of copper. Too little copper relative to zinc can give you diabetes and too much is toxic.",2020-12-18T12:33:17Z,JP dJ,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSc1klt008rONkKRlljjUVV-XELFZdlgkAM6A=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Folk who have a lot of adipose tissue (men and women) can benefit with Inositol as it reduces Insulin resistance, oddly, Inositol is also mixed with 10mcg of Vit D as well, and has a reputation of balancing hormones in both men and women. NAFLD can be treated with LiverAid Choline supplement. All these deficiencies and ailments seem to be associated with high fructose corn syrup consumption. The darker skin populations have a high corn diet which makes them deficient in Vitamin D. UCSD has done some extensive Vitamin D research as well. I’m not a doc, but respect the knowledge.

UgxnOagjA0ogcbfwfgl4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"In the early months, researchers said something to the effect that they had identified a very similar virus in Bats which somehow did not make the Bats sick.

Bats are nocturnal animals, they spend most of the day in caves, mines or under bridges. They would not produce a whole lot of Vitamin D. Would this be indicative that the insects that Bats eat are either rich in Vitamin D or perhaps contain a more efficient form of Vitamin D to fight Covid. Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin, perhaps the fat of insects is similar to cod liver oil ? Insects share many similarities with crustaceans. Perhaps a body fat high in Vitamin D is one such similarity. One article I saw on Egyptian fruit bat indicated that this species of Bat had low levels of Vitamin D serum. It it is so for the bats that carry the similar disease, then how are they resisting it ?

On the chart on countries with Yogurt fortified with Vitamin D, it would have been useful to indicate if the Yogurt were the low fat kind, which tends to have HFCS added to it to improve the flavour after the fat has been taken out.  This would make the yogurt less effective also not just because of the HFCS but because of the lower quantity of fat.   So the fortified Yogurt may not be as effective.  Dairy consumption is also dropping as people are increasingly becoming Vegan in part to fight climate change.  The milk substitutes may not be fortified the way that milk products are.",2020-12-17T06:25:26Z,Jacques Gauthier,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSZR-NNYuB6b2tjR1VFP1QvkzmKSUg0F_LzKpNf=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Have you studied the latest quantum physics discoveries and their implication in all these issues (and life itself)?

Serious concern about the table shown at 12:00 giving levels in NG/ML and NMOL/L:
The UK NHS figures in NMOL/L are:
Deficient - under 30
Insufficient - 30-50
Adequate - over 50
Those are effectively the figures you have stated as being in NG/ML.
You have then compounded the error by re-computing the NMOL/L figures via usual multiplier 2.5.
So, you are wildly overstating the classification of 25(OH)D levels.
If you disagree, please comment accordingly, and explain the origin of your figures.
If I am right, PLEASE correct your video.
I am a pro-active ANCA vasculitis patient in (re COVID-19) Clinically Extremely Vulnerable category.
I am NOT a doctor. (But I can add and multiply.)

UgyrAAKfE4DPeQ3Ggx14AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"Great presentation and addressed many questions I had.  One thing that would be nice, however, is an educated counter viewpoint regarding vitamin D associations.  Given the multitude of studies on vitamin D and various associations, you have a very coherent narrative and I think supported a belief that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial for most people. It would be interesting if that same body of literature ( not the exact studies used to point out the positives but from the available studies) were used to form the counter argument.  e.g vitamin D has no statistically beneficial benefit or perhaps can even be detrimental.  

In short, the entire discussion seemed one sided but it's not clear whether that is because all the data is one sided or the presentation/studies selected were one sided.  I'm sure Dr. Seheult tried to be as unbiased as possible but I think having a true counterpoint would be informative.

Jehovah permitted the issue to be joined. Not, however, because he was unsure of the righteousness of his own sovereignty. He needed nothing proved to himself. It was out of love for his intelligent creatures that he allowed time for the testing out of the matter. He permitted men to undergo a test by Satan, before all the universe. And he gave his creatures the privilege of proving the Devil a liar, and of removing the slander not only from God’s name but also from their own. Satan, in his egotistic attitude, was ‘given up to a disapproved mental state.’ In his approach to Eve, he had evidently been contradictory in his own reasoning. (Ro 1:28) For he was charging God with unfair, unrighteous exercise of sovereignty and, at the same time, was evidently counting on God’s fairness: He seemed to think that God would consider Himself obliged to let him live on if he proved his charge concerning the unfaithfulness of God’s creatures.


The settling of the issue was actually a matter vital to all who live, as respects their relationship to God’s sovereignty. For, once settled, such an issue would never need to be tried again. It seems apparent that Jehovah desired that full knowledge of all the questions connected with this issue be thoroughly made known and understood. The action that God took engenders confidence in his unchangeableness, it enhances his sovereignty, and it makes that sovereignty even more desirable and firmly established in the minds of all who choose it.​—Compare Mal 3:6.

A moral issue. The question, then, is not one of might, of raw strength; it is primarily a moral issue. However, because of God’s invisibility and because Satan has exerted every effort to blind men’s minds, Jehovah’s power or even his existence has at times been questioned. (1Jo 5:19; Re 12:9) Men have mistaken the reason for God’s patience and kindness and have themselves become more rebellious. (Ec 8:11; 2Pe 3:9) Because of this, it has taken faith, along with suffering, to serve God with integrity. (Heb 11:6, 35-38) Nevertheless, Jehovah purposes to make his sovereignty and his name known to all. In Egypt he said to Pharaoh: “In fact, for this cause I have kept you in existence, for the sake of showing you my power and in order to have my name declared in all the earth.” (Ex 9:16) Likewise God has allowed a time for this world and its god, Satan the Devil, to exist and develop in their wickedness, and He has set a time for their destruction. (2Co 4:4; 2Pe 3:7) The prophetic prayer of the psalmist was: “That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” (Ps 83:18) Jehovah himself has sworn: “To me every knee will bend down, every tongue will swear, saying, ‘Surely in Jehovah there are full righteousness and strength.’”​—Isa 45:23, 24.

How far the issue reached. How far-reaching was the issue? Since man had been induced to sin, and since an angel had sinned, the question reached up to and included God’s heavenly creatures, even God’s only-begotten Son, the one closest to Jehovah God. This One, who always did the things pleasing to his Father, would be most anxious to serve for the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty. (Joh 8:29; Heb 1:9) God selected him for this assignment, sending him to the earth, where he was born as a male child through the virgin Mary. (Lu 1:35) He was perfect, and he maintained that perfection and blamelessness throughout his life, even to a disgraceful death. (Heb 7:26) Before his death he said: “Now there is a judging of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.” Also: “The ruler of the world is coming. And he has no hold on me.” (Joh 12:31; 14:30) Satan could get no hold so as to break Christ’s integrity, and he was judged as having failed, ready to be cast out. Jesus “conquered the world.”​—Joh 16:33.

So Jesus Christ, in a totally perfect way, proved the Devil a liar, completely settling the question, Will any man be faithful to God under whatever test or trial may be brought against him? Jesus therefore was appointed by the Sovereign God as the Executor of His purposes, the one to be used to destroy wickedness, including the Devil, from the universe. This authority he will exercise, and ‘every knee will bend and every tongue openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.’​—Php 2:5-11; Heb 2:14; 1Jo 3:8.

In the dominion granted the Son, he rules in his Father’s name, ‘bringing to nothing’ all government and all authority and power that stand against Jehovah’s sovereignty. The apostle Paul reveals that Jesus Christ then offers the greatest tribute to Jehovah’s sovereignty, for, “when all things will have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will also subject himself to the One who subjected all things to him, that God may be all things to everyone.”​—1Co 15:24-28.",2020-12-17T15:52:26Z,Destry311,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTX-T8lUQjsP2WHnkSO-xNDzItpzwFoOiQ3Q6R58Q=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj
Ugxb_e0F6zRpBGGALF14AaABAg.9HKtzCqevye9HNP3eP57RM,Ugxb_e0F6zRpBGGALF14AaABAg,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"@Carey James Majeski 

So Jehovah, God has allowed time (over 6,000 years) for humankind to try every form of government and rulership but they have all failed to solve our problems.  God has allowed Satan to rule over this world (1 John 5: 19) He (Satan) is the ruler of the earth including all human governments, false religion and the corrupt commercial entities, trying to mislead all humankind to destruction.  God’s original purpose for the earth and humankind has not changed. At his appointed time he will destroy all governments and wicked humans and allow humble, meek humans to live forever on earth under paradise conditions, living forever. (Psalms 37: 9-11; Ps. 37: 29; Re. 21: 3, 4) 

This makes sense, if you built a beautiful home and allowed a family member to live there and they trashed the home and were unappreciative, what would you do? Allow them to continue living there? Remove them and destroy the home? Of course not, you would remove the family member, repair the home and let other family members live there that would truly appreciate it and take care of it.  The same is true of God. He will remove the wicked to allow the righteous to live in peaceful harmony forever.

The other issue you brought up was God destroying life, like during the flood. Why?  You need to examine the facts.  What were conditions on earth like?",2020-12-17T15:53:08Z,Destry311,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTX-T8lUQjsP2WHnkSO-xNDzItpzwFoOiQ3Q6R58Q=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Genesis 6: 5, 11, 12 describes what the world was like  “Consequently, Jehovah saw that man’s wickedness was great on the earth and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time. But the earth had become ruined in the sight of the true God, and the earth was filled with violence. Yes, God looked upon the earth, and it was ruined; all flesh had ruined its way on the earth.”   However, Noah and his family loved God and although imperfect they were good people. Genesis 6: 9, 10  “This is the history of Noah. Noah was a righteous man. He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries. Noah walked with the true God. In time Noah became father to three sons, Shem, Ham, and Jaʹpheth.” 

Another problem causing the wickedness on earth at that time was the fact that some other angels rebelled against God siding with Satan, they left their positions in heaven took human bodies and had children.  These hybrid children were especially strong and wicked. (Genesis 6: 1-4) 

Since God is righteous the flood did not come suddenly without warning. Years were spent building the ark and during that time Noah warned what was going to happen. 2 Peter 2: 5 “And he did not refrain from punishing an ancient world, but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness, safe with seven others when he brought a flood upon a world of ungodly people.”",2020-12-17T16:00:26Z,Destry311,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTX-T8lUQjsP2WHnkSO-xNDzItpzwFoOiQ3Q6R58Q=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj
Ugxb_e0F6zRpBGGALF14AaABAg.9HKtzCqevye9HNQ-YTsD3v,Ugxb_e0F6zRpBGGALF14AaABAg,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"@Carey James Majeski 

Notice that during the time that the ark was being built, Noah was preaching to others and warning them so if they choose some could have accepted the warning and been saved. So, Jehovah, God lovingly gave a long time of warning and only destroyed the wicked and protected those who loved him. This is fair even we as imperfect humans lock up wicked people in jails and prisons and some Nations pull the wicked to death, why? To protect good law abiding people. Life would be horrible if the wicked were allowed to run free among us. If we as imperfect humans have this sense of justice and recognize the need to separate the wicked from the good how much more so would God who is prefect in his justice. 

Another reason for the flood was a warning example for us today. Jesus said in the time of the end conditions on earth would be like the time of the flood. Please notice Matthew 24: 37-39 “For just as the days of Noah were, so the presence of the Son of man will be. For as they were in those days before the Flood, eating and drinking, men marrying and women being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and they took no note until the Flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be.”",2020-12-17T16:01:19Z,Destry311,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTX-T8lUQjsP2WHnkSO-xNDzItpzwFoOiQ3Q6R58Q=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

We are now living in the last days (2 Timothy 3: 1-4) The world is filled with wicked people who will not submit to God’s rulership. They are being warned Matthew 24: 14  “And this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.”  This is being done worldwide in 240 lands. 

The “good news” is that God’s Kingdom or government will soon rule the earth. (Daniel 2: 44) Only this government can and will solve our problems.  Is it fair for the righteous to live with the wicked? Of course not. We don’t allow it and God will not allow it. All we have to do is learn about Jehovah, God and his son Jesus and do his will.  John 17: 3 “This means everlasting life, their coming to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”  1 John 2: 17 “Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but the one who does the will of God remains forever.”

However there is one small caveat, well actually a big one if you are one to fuss over numbers. Your guest has made many references to studies that talk about cases of Covid-19 Since it is well established now that the PCT test, that is ubiquitous for diagnosing Covid-19 infections, is totally unreliable for determining an infectious disease, especially when run at cycles over 25, it should nullify the validity of many of these studies. The margin of error (up to 90 percent )in this test is far greater than the margin of error in the study attempting to determine if Vitamin D is useful for this 'disease'. Overall I would say, that to be more precise, we should just drop the Covid-19 reference in favor of generalized upper respiratory infection, and proclaim that vitamin D is useful as a prophylactic and as a therapy for viral illnesses. Some of your followers may even be savvy to the fact that the virus has never been isolated and purified, and so it cannot, from a scientific perspective, be proven to exist,  let alone satisfy Koch's Postulates, the gold standard for the cause of disease..",2020-12-16T02:30:40Z,skyhighdon,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTMya_jGT2Ga0S37R8u5PSzqo1R1fb2UJgX8g=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

It's recommended that an obese person (BMI > 30) has 3.0x recommended dose, does that mean that 2.0x recommended dose will be stored in the fat with with rest staying in the blood. If this is true, then surely over time the fat will get saturated with vitamin D (I'm assuming there is only a finite storage capacity in the fat for vitamin D ).

I did push myself to get up and move and made mock chicken soup to open airways. It felt like a brick was shoved in middle of my chest. My bloodwork earlier in Drs.’s office showed my vitamin d levels were high so guess I had enough to help. I also take aspirin everyday for aneurism so that also kept me from getting a blood clot.

It may well be the higher levels of exposure to the Sun for Africans in Africa than their African American cousins in more northern climes. 

Exposure to the sun is the very best source of vitamin D. Higher levels of obesity amongst African American exacerbates the problem by restricting the absorption of Vitamin D into the body.

https://www.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/kc1tke/a_theory_on_the_seasonality_of_respiratory/
It's rather rambling so TLDR:
Primary Contentions:
1. Enveloped Respiratory Viruses like COVID-19 can improve their fitness by evolving to take advantage of the hosts vitamin D system to serve as a signal for whether it is the time of year that it can spread best by inducing the immune system to make the host cough.
2. Calcifediol actually has considerable biological activity independent of calcitriol, which is what has long been thought of as the only active form. If there is only one signal then the system cannot distinguish between spring and fall. Having two independent signals where one trails the other in time allows for differentiation between spring and fall by paying attention to whether one has been rising or falling relative to one another. 
3. Such a signal would require amplification and this is found to be the case. This is very unusual as normally homeostasis is achieved when a receptor's activation moderates its own expression.",2020-12-14T22:05:50Z,Michael A,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRoMyQnFrQh0M2nrM5-VaT5Vvs7td59iBHPfg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgxaGEdL_0awuh70dLd4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"List of posts --- The following is why I do this work, trying to alert more to what is really going on. 
Who rules this world? Jesus answered that; John 14:30 I will not speak with you much more, for the ruler of the world is coming ...
Satan rules this world, and has DIRECT control over the governments. This is confirmed for us in Luke 4:5 So he brought him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time. 6 Then the Devil said to him: “I will give you all this authority and their glory, because it has been handed over to me, and I give it to whomever I wish … --- You should carefully note that Jesus DID NOT accuse Satan of lying when Satan made this claim of ruling the world of men. 
In Daniel ch 10:13, 20, you can read where there are demon princes in direct control of each government. How does man fix this? The answer is obvious; man can not fix it; only Jesus can. Most claim to believe in Jesus, but do you really? Read John 14:12 in your own Bible and think on it. Deeply. Remember, please, that you are revealed by your actions and not by your words; actions ALWAYS speak louder than words. 
That all of the evil on this earth is now being revealed is proof that Jesus is once again active on the earth; 1 Cor 4:5 Therefore, do not judge anything before the due time, until the Lord comes. He will bring the secret things of darkness to light and make known the intentions of the hearts, and then each one will receive his praise from God. --- Satan is no longer able to hide the actions of his servants from the general population (see 2 Cor 4:4). The Lord in this verse is Jesus; lord of lords and king of kings on the earth. Jesus will not be visibly revealed until Armageddon, but by then it will be too late for most. If you wish to know more, carefully read and think deeply about the next versus;
KJ21 Psalm 83:18 that men may know that Thou, whose name alone is Jehovah, art the Most High over all the earth.
KJ21 John 17:3 And this is life eternal: that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.
The Holy Name Jehovah is in the original Scriptures more than 7,000 times, but is in the AV King James only 4 times, showing how men under the direction of Satan have done their best to separate us from our Heavenly Father and His protection for us. What is the first thing you learn about someone when you meet them? Is it not their NAME? How many people do you KNOW, but you DO NOT know their name? That is an impossibility. 
Here is a list of the reports I have prepared and have posted on youtube. If there is one or more that you would like to read, please request them by Email; rich5151@gmx.com. 
Posts based on the Bible; Good News; Does the Bible tell us the whole story about the Jesus?; Divine Name; Who Rules; How to understand the Bible; Critical Times; Human Rule; Who is the AntiChrist; Temple rebuilt; Spiritual Temple; Rulership; Ruler of the World; Bible NOW; Revelation, Not Under Law; Marriage – 3 different; Jesus; Is there a True Christian religion?; Happiness; God is Love; God Bless America; Evil; Democracy; Constitution; Church; Bible; Bible2; Bible Verses; Bible Principles; Balflour; Armageddon (rewritten); Government; Love; Holy Spirit; Hell does not exist; I Believe; Not fixable; Wake up!; Satan; Spiritually dead; Spiritually alive; Salvation is life; Not Under Law; World; Apostasy; Apostasy 2; Death; Famine; The BIG LIE; Preaching; God’s Will; What is God’s Kingdom?; Apple cider vinegar; If… Jesus is God; Christian; Lies, God is Love; and Learn to love? (now ready). Learn to Love is the last post/report I will prepare. Time is far to short to do much more. Please think deeply on what YOU need to be doing NOW….. with the Bible. Listening to more lies from men, or? Learning the Truth directly from the Bible; John 17:17 Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth. --- This is directly from Jesus to us.

Its what makes sure that your immune system doesn't destroy your body. I've been taking multi-vitamins, with about 125% of Vitamin D, for the past year and a half. I can say that the combo of Vitamin C and D has borderline eliminated my seasonal allergies, and I can honestly not tell you the last time I have gotten severely sick. Well, at least within the time frame of taking the vitamins. I eat relatively healthy, and go to the gym about four times a week. Yes, even during the pandemic. I feel as though its another case of survival of the fittest. I know its an unpopular opinion, but people can die from complications of the common cold if they aren't healthy enough. Every virus and bacteria is a potential threat to your body. And if you aren't preparing your body for a potential infection, it could be severe or fatal. Now, yes healthy people have died during this pandemic. There are those rare cases. But, I just feel that us as humans have grown way to complacent with an advanced medical system and procedures to make us ""healthy"" that we don't take personal responsibility of our own health.

If VitD3 had much of an effect on RNS transcription in cell nuclei you would be dead taking it for too long.
RNA transcription is the bread an butter of pretty much every process in the cell (how every protein is made)

If VitD had RNA transcription blocking effects - it would be considered to be chemotherapy. (thats how some chemotherapy agents work)

mRNA vaccine is merley hijacking a pathway used by millions of other mRNA fragments (actually trillions upon trillions cells produce) for a particular antibody unique to SARS-COV-2. i.e using our own cell machinery to produce the antibody directly rather than via a real virus. Its not incredible different that using inactive viruses - just more like a short cut bypassing parts of the immune system to directly produce antibodies from mRNA.

Bottom line - any drug messing around to block RNA transcription would be considered chemotherapy related as in ""cytotoxic""

Thus being in countries that get less intense sun and skin tone blocking vit D would make us more susceptible, and that's what seems to be the case.

Except for the fact that we don’t have to kill other animals (human, land or marine) to get vitamin D, or anything else that is good for us. It’s actually ABSURD, unnatural, abnormal, unethical, self destructive, even deadly. 

Let’s not forget that in order to get the vitamins from someone else’s flesh, secretions, eggs, we’ll have no choice but to get cholesterol, hormones, fat, antibiotics, blood and diseases that come along. 

In addition, animal agriculture is the main reason for massive pollution, land degradation, hunger, oceans dead zones, deforestation, wildlife extinction, droughts, viruses and violence. 

Therefore, taking one vitamin D capsule or 30 min. sun a day seems most logical, natural, ethical, most importantly effective solution.

At 47kg of nitrogen per person each year, Australia is far ahead of the US, which came in with 28kg of nitrogen per person. ⟶ A high-animal-protein diet appears to be driving Australia’s big nitrogen footprint.

YARA and Climate Smart Agriculture — Instead of taking responsibility for it’s role in rising green house gasses and locking farmers into dependent relationships, Yara has positioned itself to sit within a large number of bodies and organisations that claim to be working towards adapting to climate change suggesting they are the “provider of environmental solutions” who “address global challenges and create positive change.” [5] In so doing they cleverly situate themselves where their voices will be heard, and from where they can direct the course of climate negotiations with regard to agriculture. — The largest is GACSA, The Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture. 60% of the alliance’s membership is made up of fertilizer companies. A clear indication of which direction climate smart agriculture will move in – one based on the use of toxic chemicals, smart data, increased machinery and technology. This name is not only misleading as there is no concrete definition of what “climate smart” is, it also allows companies to get away with doing serious harm. | SOURCE: https://aseed.net/yara-a-mass-producer-of-synthetic-nitrogen-fertilizer-and-what-this-means-for-the-planet/

JUNE 1, 2020 | Head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, Jeff Currie, says that the two commodities standing on shaky ground right now are oil and livestock. Speaking to reporters last week, Currie’s forecast comes after weeks of worrying news headlines spotlighting the chaos that the coronavirus has wreaked on the animal meat industry. Food security experts believe that the global food supply chain must make a drastic shift away from traditional animal agriculture moving forward in order to save both human and animal lives, as well as the environment. | SOURCE: https://lnkd.in/dEEwJtS

Yara’s facility in Sluiskil, the Netherlands, currently relies on gas that comes from Groningen in the north of the country, as well as relying on imported fracked gas from the USA. Also a highly intensive process, fracking involves drilling on average 2,347 metres into the earth and pumping water, toxic chemicals, fracking fluid and sand into these holes to obtain gas and oil. Fracking has been linked to soil contamination, water and air pollution, earthquakes and increased health risks for local communities.]] https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6614924236567965696-2kVi

Ugza1iWwGK8OZ0TbD_h4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"Vitamins D and C are antioxidants, specifically of vascular membranes. They scavenge metabolic waste in the endothelium, which allows for the smooth transport of nutrients, gases, etc. from and to the bloodstream, lungs, etc. Covid attacks these same membranes. What else does? DIETARY FAT. Read the J Obes paper ""High fat diet induces adhesion of platelets to endothelium in two models of dyslipidemia"". 
All key risk factors for Covid morbidity (excluding being extremely old) are dietary - type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, etc. All causing excess fat and cholesterol in the bloodstream. There are 2 complicating factors: 1) dark-skinned people do not receive enough sunlight in northern climates to produce sufficient vitamin D. 2) Vitamin D is produced subcutaneously in the skin, and from there transfered to the bloodstream - vitamin D utilization is severely inhibited by...again, OBESITY aka dietary fat. And who suffers the most from type-2 diabetes and similar dietary diseases? Dark-skinned people, who are at a disadvantage for vitamin D production.
Get the idea? The solution is not to take vitamin D supplements, though it's a perfectly reasonable thing to do right now - it's to eat a diet for which your body is designed, which would be low in fat and high in antioxidants like vitamin C. Eat more plants and less meat, dairy, oil and eggs.
We have a long-term epidemic of utter scientific stupidity, which I believe begins with the failure of MDs to understand human nutrition and admit the obvious - humans are designed to eat low-fat, starch-based diets. Any deviation causes chronic disease, and in the case of coronaviruses sets you up to suffer worse from infectious disease.

The vast majority of those within the #military have no idea of what has been done to them, and how they are being used against the world...do NOT take the shot, ANY shot.
(the military is only one small piece, those within their chosen groups and organizations are likely also being used against themselves and each other in a multitude of other destructive ways that need to be realized and stopped)
I didn't realize things were wrong until I stopped ""serving"" that beast system for 21 years in the military...that was about 4 years ago. I have apologized and attempted to explain as much as could, as deeply as I could, on what I learned from my healing process in the hope it could help someone, feel free to see what I have posted.
 ...in my humble opinion, when the majority of men and women can think and feel, deeply and clearly, simultaneously, free of toxins and contradictions within, the generational evil and enslavement will end due to true internal and external #awareness of the need for acceptance, repentance, healing, growing, knowing, and truly living and being what is right, with the ability to simply and clearly point out wrong.
...the journey to #Truth is within, it a journey to your own organic connection to you, in a wholly unified sense, with all senses, in connection with the creation of the most High. Organic truth and wisdom is gained on that Inner journey that no man or woman of any false status will be able to take from you, or twist within you.
The time is now, it always has been, and always will be, each for a limited amount of heartbeats, please do waste one more of your own, your #time and #energy are the true #currency being stolen.

rights do not come from a piece of paper, and a paper is not required to know, express, and live what is right, what is the constitution of your body, mind, and spirt? may it not be a piece of paper, but who, what, why you are

Why we have to wear a mask over our nose constantly when it is contrary to our own survival because we need to breath Oxygen, not CO2 ? Why Oxygen and Ozone therapies have not been used for fighting this Covid19 virus yet ?  Oxygen is reknown to kills all virus and bacteria, so why no one had used these therapies yet ?  Why we need a 2 meters distanciation constantly when there is no solid scientific foundation base on that stupid measure by the WHO ?  Who is the president of the WHO and why that he did not have any competence what so ever in the medical field at all ? Why no one is telling people to take vitamins A, C, D and Zinc to prevent any infection by the Covid19 virus instead of all these stupid and non sense WHO measures ?  Why hydroxychloriquine is not use here when hundreds of thousand of people have been successfully treated with it and the zinc supplement in Marseille (France) by Dr. Didier Raoult ?  Why we are force by our governments to take the new and untested dangerous vaccines from the Big Pharma industry that suddenly are emerging all at the ''same time'' during this Fake Pandemic of Covid19 which was already planned a long time ago and to be spread worldwide (see and listen to this excellant documentary on www.plandemicseries.com) ?   Does it have any connection to the Agenda 21 for reducing the planet population by more than 90% because the Agenda 21 goal was keep only 500 000 humans on earth ?  And now we have a new option with ivermectin for fighting Covid19 which was already tested and successful ?

Ugz65Q0IG6t3ItKd6AZ4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"One reason Dr. Seheult doesn’t mention K-2 MK-7 with respect to optimal performance of vitamin D may be that some fermented vitamins and probiotics carry a small risk of causing opportunistic infection in individuals with compromised immune systems, but normally only in persons first prescribed with, and agreed to take, antibiotics to combat or avoid infection with major surgery, and then were prescribed an intravenous fermented product, such as certain kinds of probiotics that share traits with vitamin K-2 MK-7, due to their poor gut health they experienced on account of the antibiotic previously administered.  You have to decide if you are in a high risk group, and if your major problem is osteopenia, and you are in other ways in perfect and excellent health, with no underlying conditions, do treat your bone health as the highest priority, in which case take the minis lie risks associated with use of fermented products.  Of course screen your fermented products carefully - be ultra selective with your choice of fermentation - and all of these complications are a reason for starting with lower doses and increasing gradually.  I do not know my body’s tolerable vitamin K-2 MK-7 limit, but I control for antibiotics by refusing to take any, and I get away without antibiotics by my use of Listerine mouthwash at least once per day.  No one, as far as I know, has done a study of Listerine mouthwash use with Vitamin K-2 MK-7 consumption, but the amount of antibiotic in Listerine available to enter your bloodstream or lungs when you gargle it is minuscule in relation to where the vitamin K-2 MK-7 lands in your system.  I guess space your first Listerine gargle of the day several hours after your Vitamin K-2 MK-7 dose for the day, and don’t split your dose of Vitamin K-2 MK-7 in half, but take all of the fermented product at once, and again, take the ferment several hours prior to your Listerine gargle.  Hope this helps!",2020-12-13T06:59:30Z,Kathleen Taylor,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRGCbkXSC-Vp6b6m86laJoT1cwCef5erqcf0VMXIQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgxlmwN5SHau8R_dzFJ4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,Wow!  What an eye opener!  I have been aware of the connection between fighting off the flu and vitamin D for over 15 years.  I always took vitamin D in the winter but never got the flu shot to protect me from the flu.  It has worked for me.  Beginning earlier this year some medical folks began suggesting Covid 19 may also be lessened by the use of vitamin D.  Until now I had seen no evidence to support that opinion.  This video fully confirms that vitamin D is a key in protecting against covid 19.  It is a long and somewhat technical report that explores hundreds of studies that support that finding.  Bottom line.... take your vitamin D this winter!

UgzmJxtcNtQb89Xe85V4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"Excellent presentation, as always. I do have some questions though. There are a number of issues when talking about sunlight as a source of vitD, for example clothing and what that does to attenuate the process through the skin. In hot climates we may wear thin white coverings and that will attenuate the sunlight. Does the UV penetrate through? How do countries that require women to wear burkas deal with VitD levels? Also, are there any studies that look at exposure and the related VitD levels that the sunlight produces. Finally, there is a trade off with respect to sunlight exposure and skin cancer. My doctor and dermatologist both ask frequently if I sun bathe or not and imply this might not be a good thing to do. So we need guidance an how to best optimize this behavior. The argument of winter as an accelerator makes sense but in in summer, Florida for example, it is so hot and humid that we are driven indoor with AC just as much as northern places being driven indoors for heat in winter.

Watched your ventilator, ABG's and other video's as I'm finishing 2 year 1 semester Respiratory Care School. Finals are next week and then one more semester!!!! I have a question? With recent sharp spikes in cases; should we not be going back to the basics of this disease? Particularly, how it is spread? Maybe we have misconceptions of how its really spread which would help explain the recent spikes. I remember data in the beginning showing it could live on plastic for 3 days and Cardboard for a day; if I remembered it correctly.  My point maybe we are missing a contact component to it. I was at the gas station the other day filling up because I was headed to my Childrens Hospital rotation; people were grabbing the gas pump, typing their pins in the machine and while standing there filling up, they were touching their phones and their mouths and getting into their vehicles without hand sanitizer or hand washing. I'm just saying maybe it is time to look at that kind of data again and see if we are missing something or maybe we need to be more concerned with direct contact and how long COVID can live on things (fomites)? I really think we are underestimating the importance of fomites in COVID transmission. When aerosolized when those droplets settle down and dry out; is the virus viable on that object (fomite) for X amount of time?

Ugy5eCkKU4JAw8PjTSV4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"Further thoughts. It's noted that Finland fortifies their dairy products with vitamin D. Possibly why the have had such success in dealing with C-19. Vitamin D has been recognised to regulate the adaptive immune system ( here at 22:22) . This is why it has been so successful in C-19 symptom severity reduction. Consider that the adaptive immune response (cytokine storms, macrophage and T Cell activity against self) are hallmarks of autoimmune diseases (Type 1 diabetes, Multiple Sclerosis, etc) as well as C-19. 

After mandating vitamin D be added to dairy products in 2003 the Finnish youth population saw their collective serum vitamin D content rise from ~65 nmol/L to ~80 nmol/L (Makinen et al (2014) which shortly thereafter saw the incidence of type 1 diabetes plateau (Harjutsalo et al 2013). This escalation of serum vitamin D was enough to be effective yet it was not optimal. I propose that if the serum content was elevated to an ideal 110  nmol/l the incidence would have plummeted to zero.

Notably the type 1 diabetes problem in Finland  became more pronounced after the 1950s, Harjutsalo et al 2013 noted, when the amount of vitamin D recommended for supplementation in infants was reduced to one-tenth and the incidence of T1D increased fivefold.  BTW Canada does indeed fortify their milk with vitamin D but it's in no where near high enough concentrations to regulate the adaptive immune response, which is why they have such high prevalences of T1D and MS etc.",2020-12-12T04:31:59Z,NickT,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT1bOmjwlKNjIhEkYRsKypC6gBDIa6iejRq_Q=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

I see people at pharmacies picking up D3, and I tell them ""take the bottle next to it;  it has D3 and K2, together"",  but they don't believe me even after I explain to them the risk of calcium never reaching the bones, but accumulating in the arteries instead.

UgzOrHhQ5pPUVcjrBdx4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"According to the official statistics, South Africa has turned into one of the greatest epicenters of Covid-19 in the world. Since the beginning of April to the 12th July, the cumulative number of infections in South Africa has doubled about every 14 days. On 12 July 2020, 264,184 cumulative cases have been recorded, slightly more than double the 131,800 on 28 June, 14 days before. South Africa was firmly on track to record half a million cumulative infections by 25 July. Community spread appeared unstoppable. At that rate of increase, 1 million would have been infected by 8 August, 2 million by 22 August, 4 million by 5 September, 8 million by 19 September, 16 million by 3 October and some 32 million by 17 October 2020. That would represent 53% of the population of over 59 million people. The daily number of new infections should then have dropped off steeply.  On that trend, over the first two weeks of October, between one and two million new infections were likely to occur daily. The growth of new cases in adjoining areas, such as Zimbabwe, Namibia, Eswatini, Botswana and Lesotho was much, much slower. The cumulative number of cases per million of the population in South Africa is now more than 2.4 times greater than in Namibia and Eswatini, the two most affected of those countries.
However, on 13 July, the number of new cases in South Africa dropped significantly by about 1,440, or about 11%. The day before, the 12 July 2020, sales of alcoholic beverages were prohibited in South Africa, creating a false impression that the ban was the cause of the drop in numbers. However, this is false, because the normal lag period of some 5 to 10 days between the introduction of a new measure that is effective, and a reduction in case numbers, was completely absent, clearly identifying it as fake. This trend of a reduction of new cases continued daily and became progressively stronger. The result was that, today, 12 December, with a second (or third?) wave underway, the official cumulative number of cases in South Africa stands at 845,083 instead of well over 50% of the population, had the 'trend' of doubling every 13 or 14 days continued. It had taken some 139 days to double to this number. There is no rational reason for a ban on liquor sales to cause such a sudden, steep drop in new cases. Hence the conclusion is that, over the three-and-a-half months before 12 July, the numbers have been manipulated up, as were the numbers on recoveries. Death numbers, on the other hand, were manipulated down: https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2020-07-29-excess-deaths-soar-to-more-than-four-times-official-covid-19-toll-mrc-data-shows/ 
The question is, why have the case numbers been manipulated up? 
Early this year, South Africa applied for an IMF loan of US$4.3 billion at a very low interest rate. On 27 July, the IMF publicly announced that the loan was granted -  https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/07/27/pr20271-south-africa-imf-executive-board-approves-us-billion-emergency-support-covid-19-pandemic Most likely, South Africa was informed of the grant earlier than the public announcement, perhaps around 12 July? Clearly, the numbers in South Africa have been manipulated up to impress on the IMF an urgent need for funds to fight the epidemic in the country. Most of the funds are likely to land in the pockets of corrupt people in positions of power and their family.
A further question is, what is the real motive for the ban on liquor sales? 
The answer is that the ban on liquor sales will most likely drive many liquor stores out of business. The liquor trade is seen as lucrative, easy business. White owners of such businesses are exempt on a racist basis of financial assistance to weather the covid storm, including the IMF funds. Many of these businesses are likely to go bankrupt and be bought up at bargain prices by black politicians, their family members https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-31-ace-magashules-sons-each-bag-a-free-state-covid-19-contract/amp/?__twitter_impression=true and other black business people, perhaps using some of the IMF funds paid for other contracts where contract prices have been loaded - https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/covid-19-sahrc-set-to-probe-gauteng-health-spending-amid-corruption-claims-20200730
And https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-30-province-to-disclose-ppe-procurement-details-to-avoid-corruption/
And https://mg.co.za/coronavirus-essentials/2020-08-06-the-ppe-scandal-that-the-treasury-hasnt-touched/
Fraud and corruption assume many a guise. The South African government is rotten through from top to bottom and the people in power are out on the loot. They saw an opportunity and they jumped on it.  But at the same time, they are doing the South African population a grave disservice, endangering peoples' lives and livelihoods -  subsequent waves of infections in South Africa are being masked by the huge false first wave. But, what the hell, never miss the opportunities a good crisis offers for personal enrichment, hey? This time, however, the South African black elite defrauded and made fools of the international community, their co-members of the IMF, rather than their own citizens – perhaps strategically a grave error?

Is this evidence of the use of calcidefiol? The publication of Castillo et al was in July so it's feasible the application could have been applied throughout the 15 hospitals in the country as the article indicated.

I count myself really lucky that a family friend who is a nurse opened my eyes to the problem of vitamin D deficiency Worldwide back in January before the pandemic really kicked off. I started watching a lot of YouTube videos at that time especially by Dr Michael Holick who has been researching this for years but has not been listened to. I then started supplementing with 10,000 IU/day (+K2) and so far no sickness.

I managed to convince most of my family to supplement at 4-5000IU/day and no sickness there either. A lot of my friends have been a lot harder to get through to and are convinced I am poisoning myself with overdosing! Two of them have gone down with covid so far so maybe I wil have the last laugh. I am in the UK by the way so well above the 35th parallel. I was sunbathing a bit more than usual during the Summer as well but no point in that now!

I must admit I am fed up with hearing ""correlation is not causation"". Some people i.e. politicians need to wake up and take notice what is in front of their eyes. I guess there is no money in vitamin D for their cronies in big pharma.

I notice a lot of the cited studies are older, and probably many should be disregarded for one reason or another. But the number of studies is worrisome, as well as some newer ones such as an NHANES study in 2019, and a Canadian study also in 2019 and followup in 2020.

UgyFWXt5SmSLuH1rvt94AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,If you read Michael Hollick's recent paper with a co-author you will see that one of the most fascinating things about vitamin D is that it's simultaneously improves pathogen resistance by increasing/up regulating anti pathogen proteins that are part of immune defense and at the same time clamping down on several families of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in sepsis and so-called cytokine storm. In other words it is both able to improve immune competence while dampening the destructive effects of inflammation on our own tissues. We have seen widespread uncritical acceptance of the meme from the Institute of Medicine that anything over 30 is an adequate level. A boatload of research suggests that a desirable target level is actually more like 45 to 65. An interesting question in that regard is at what level does the body start storing excess vitamin D in body fat. That appears to happen over 50 suggesting that that is the target we should be aiming for. In other words evolution created that set point for transition to storage because that was the level we needed to achieve in order to get through the more sunlight deprived winter months. This is a very valuable talk.,2020-12-11T20:16:18Z,Douglas Watt,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQMTODEJNEh4FJpsnkLMVMPtkRcOrAywy2yVhQKPA=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj
Ugzz9P5LFUmSFjRq-_J4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"I am a retired general surgeon. Back in about 2005 an article in the orthopedic literature showed that patients with low vitamin D levels had a high risk of postoperative wound infection. Thereafter I obtained vitamin D levels on every one of my patients who presented for elective surgery. If their vitamin D levels were not optimal I placed them on 5000 units of vitamin D3 per day along with high doses of diet vitamin C and broad-spectrum multivitamins, In preparation for their elective surgery. I also obtained vitamin D levels on patients that presented in the emergency room with necrotizing fasciitis or necrotizing cellulitis. Not surprisingly, every one of these severely infected patients had very low levels of vitamin D, less than about 15. 
In 2013, I took over the care of a postoperative patient for another surgeon who was going on a short vacation. This patient had been on the ventilator for a few weeks, a “chronic lunger,“ very frail, unable to overcome the work of breathing sufficiently to get off the ventilator. The day after I took over I had to take her back to surgery because her ileostomy had to necrosed; this required opening the abdomen again to mobilize the ileum and create a new ileostomy: obviously not good for her lungs. Soon her vitamin D level came back: “<3,” that is, immeasurable. I asked Pharmacy to put 50,000 units of vitamin D in her tube feedings daily, which the primary surgeon continued upon his return a few days later. Within 48 hours she had gained strength enough to be extubated and within a few weeks she was discharged from the hospital. Only an anecdote, but I was impressed. I keep my vitamin D levels at about 70, for which I take 6500 international units vit D3 per day, as part of a broad-spectrum regimen to support the immune system.",2020-12-11T20:15:58Z,Douglas palenschat,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTtqGRjbeaO20Go8Arb_AYztTgxaAxl1ZTdeTHO=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Calcium so that Vit D does not pull it out of your bones (in case your diet does have sufficient Calcium) AND Vit K being very critical, since Vit D pulls Calcium and puts it in blood circulation (which you do not want), and Vit K2 being essential in taking that Calcium from circulation and directing it to bones.

But poor people in rich countries like US eat even more junk food than the average population. Though eating rice, potatoes, beans & veggies would be cheaper, the culture is sick. Not to mention you can grow food. Very sad to see, though thankfully people are starting to wake up.

I grew up eating a traditional Iranian diet that is highly plant-based, and all my grandparents, grand uncles and aunts lived beyond 80, sometimes 100, in good physical & mental health. Today I'm vegan, and most people around me are veganish. We also take vitamins & don't use toxic chemical products for house & personal hygiene. We NEVER get sick. Add meditation, spending time outdoors in nature, laughter, fasting if necessary, medicinal plants/essential oils, and you can prevent/cure basically anything. 

What is going on in the world is a crime against humanity, not only covid but all lifestyle related preventable & curable illnesses. Because money matters more than anything to the mafia ruling the world.

UgxdPtlOb8wxU_y9GDF4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"An excellent presentation. It is likely that the mechanism of efficacy pertaining to vitamin D3 is its membrane anti-oxidative potential. The supportive epidemiological data has been quite impressive. I think that the cytokine similarity between Covid19 and vitamin D deficiency may be slightly spurious. While Covid19  may induce a cytokine milieu that includes those that may occur as a consequence of Th1 and Th17 (this is not to say that either Th1 or Th17 are particularly activated in Covid19), vitamin D3 is known to interfere with Th1 and Th17 expression. Thus a deficiency in vitamin D3 might be said to permit excesses in IL-6 etc. that might otherwise characterise a Th17 response. As for the severity in population group with Covid19 and its overlap with the vitamin D deficient, this analysis needs verification. One of the conclusions that I had reached in a rather modest narrative review, published in the online only European Medical Journal entitled 'Primer on the pathogenesis of severe Covid19' - in 2 parts, was that the populations in which severe Covid19 manifested all tended to have pre-existing high levels of Protein Kinase R (a viral response element) which also happens to form part of the integrated stress response (as in for example obesity, diabetes, CVD, the elderly). 
I have followed your lecture series throughout the pandemic and I think that your coverage and incisive analysis have been second to none. Keep up the good work.",2020-12-11T13:39:14Z,Tom Walsh,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQH3jdoT_8WDsCwCRT9u8cU_G0u3w88twQfaA=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Ugy0SvxGpi_BStoWdhh4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"I am going to make this into THREE PARTS: (I tried to come in here and 'edit' this to make it more 'readable' and some of the material got lost... - here goes AGAIN:

Vitamin D-3 DOSAGE PROTOCOLS 
PART I - THE DOSAGE PROTOCOL DURING ANY PANDEMIC: (for prevention for most people who are deficient and anyone who wants to boost their immune system to a healthy level) ...should be:
1) 30,000 I.U. for THREE days (a 'hammer dose'). AFTER the first three days of Vitamin D-3, then you bring it down to 10,000 I.U. a day but NOT less than 6,000 I.U. during any pandemic period to ensure you have a system strong enough to fight COVID-19 and have better odds of having a lesser impact from the virus (hence, not the severe to critical impact) and greater chances of survival. It can take up to TWO MONTHS for levels to reach 70 to 100 ng/mL of 1,25(OH)2-D (the best level of the natural 'transformed' form of Vitamin D in the body) to have a robust immune system). Anything BELOW 60ng/mL is not a 'robust' immune system - especially not during the pandemic! There is NO - REPEAT - NO - Toxicity for levels 30,000 I.U. of Vitamin D-3 and below. The ONLY concern would be for people with small kidneys or who have kidney problems of any sort (they should consult their doctor) - HOWEVER, Vitamin D-3 plays an important role in preventing kidney cancer and should still be taken by these people - yet, under the close supervision of a doctor for these patients. These patients should NEVER - EVER - take Vitamin D-3 without Vitamin K-2! - WITH:
2) 80-200 mcg (micrograms) of Vitamin K-2 (AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE WITH VITAMIN D-3! It prevents Vit D from depositing too much calcium in the blood vessels) - NOTE: Vitamin K-2 has a 'half-life' of 72 hours. People who do not have COVID-19 can take ONE gelule (gel capsule) of 100 mcg each day or every three days (minimum) - however, during the pandemic, it is BEST to take 180-200 mcg EACH DAY while people take higher doses of Vitamin D-3 to help them build a robust immune system to fight COVID-19; PLUS: 
3) 3,000 to 4,000 mg of Omega-3 (This will prevent the micro-coagulation caused by COVID-19, will keep the blood nice and 'thin' and keep the walls of blood vessels nice and flexible) ...the BEST form is from Seal Oil as its molecular structure is more compatible with human physiology as the ends of the molecules are different ...from a mammal source ...and much better absorbed ...therefore MORE EFFICIENT than from flax seed or fish sources. NOTE: Omega-3 Seal Oil also works wonders for the microbiome gut bacteria health! Adding Omega-3 will also help prevent the clogging and micro-coagulation of small blood vessels in the kidneys in synergy with Vitamin K-2 - so these are a 'MUST HAVE' - especially, for kidney patients! This will reduce the incidence of kidney failure seen in COVID-19 patients as well. NOTE: You CANNOT 'overdose' on Omega-3 - they are natural fats (Fatty acids)! ; AND:
4) you need to take a 9-strain probiotic supplement (minimum) 1-2 times a day to ensure you preserve your microbiome health (It will also contributes in the absorption of the previous nutrients listed here). PLUS:
5) One 250 mg tablet of magnesium (Extra strength) - this is essential in OVER 800 KNOWN mechanisms in the human body! If you want a strong immune system this is what you MUST DO! 
6) You can add a zinc supplement (one tablet to some included in a multi-vitamin is good) to this regimen; AND,
7) Vitamin C (2,500 - 3,000 mg a day is best during the pandemic) – 1,000 mg a day for a ‘maintenance dose’ during non-pandemic periods along with a good diet. 
Part II coming…",2020-12-11T12:32:45Z,RoyalSnowbird,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT5Vm09G-ckx1yv7E39ign43OUWzBzOKgQfs01l=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj
Ugy0SvxGpi_BStoWdhh4AaABAg.9H7aMmzySE69H7b7mMCuGp,Ugy0SvxGpi_BStoWdhh4AaABAg,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"Part III
'MAINTENANCE' DOSES: 
You cannot obtain enough Vitamin D-3 from diet alone - hence, you must either go through skin exposure to the sun and/or take supplements to have a healthy immune system.

VIA SKIN EXPOSURE TO GET VITAMIN D PRODUCTION VIA THE SKIN:
FIRST: do NOT put any sunscreen on your skin. Wear a garment to expose your arms and legs and body which is decent but maximizes sun exposure. Get enough sunshine exposure so that the skin become slightly 'pink' (between 20-30 minutes - longer if you have a natural darker skin tone) - DO NOT BURN! After this, you can put a good sunscreen on to reduce the odds of getting skin cancer later. One proper exposure will produce the blood equivalent of having taken 10,000 I.U. of a Vitamin D-3 supplement.
VIA SUPPLEMENTS:
NOTE: to begin, it can take one to two months for a deficient person to bring their blood levels to what can be considered a 'healthy level' - in some cases, even longer. . . It is harder to reach a 'robust' level (desirable during a pandemic crisis to fight any pathogen which impacts the lungs especially.). 
NOTE: the paltry 400 I.U. children get from drinking Vitamin D-3-enriched milk is BARELY enough to ward off Ricketts IF the child drinks THREE good glasses of milk EACH day! Ricketts is currently on the rise in North America because children do not get a sufficient amount of Vitamin D-3 and because they do not go play outside and expose their skin to the sun enough to produce it naturally via the skin. . .

For a strong immune system the 'key' dose for children 5 to 12 years old is: 1,000 I.U. (MAKE sure they get Vitamin K-2 source from chick peas, eggs or a supplement as well - and - Omega-3 ALWAYS!)
From age 12 to age 18, they should be taking 2,000 I.U. a day. 
After that age (18), increase to the 'adult' dose up to 3,000-6,000 I.U. a day (Higher doses are recommended for people who do not get sufficient sun exposure (such as in the winter), are obese, have diabetes, are immuno-compromised, are older, have cancer, have a tendency to have colds, the flu or pneumonia more easily, have allergies, or have darker skin tones than our Caucasian fellow-human beings). Senior citizens should GRADUALLY increase their dose under the supervision of their doctor as they may have kidney issues as they age. EVERYONE should get their doctor to CHECK their level of 1,25(OH)2-D in the blood to get an idea how your levels are and 'adjust' accordingly ...take a higher dose for longer or decrease if the level is a bit high – do NOT go over 100 ng/mL. 
TAKING Vitamin D-3 is IMPORTANT - especially, if the individual does not get enough sun exposure to produce Vit D-3 via the skin and/or is of a dark skin tone (such people have a harder time producing Vitamin D-3 via sun exposure ...hence, the reason most are seriously-deficient and are among those who are most at risk to die of COVID-19!)
This advice comes from our ‘Think Tank’ of 189 scientists and professionals around the world (of which I am the founder and President) - you will NOT find us ANYWHERE on social media for good reason... (We work freely - independently from any government, business or entity - we 'answer' to NO ONE - we share and discuss science to work for the safety and sustainability of humanity's food chain and health. We are a group of volunteer scientists and professionals from many fields of science who share their science and support the science of its members for the 'greater good' of humanity. . .) We have been KNOCKING on the doors of governments, politicians and the media to get the 'message' across about Vitamin D-3 to inform citizens how they can boost their immune system to help fight COVID-19 for more than 11 months now. . . Indeed, you got this from scientists DEDICATED to their field, have used this to treat patients and truly have humanity's best interest at heart! Recent trials and more science today is giving us reason. . . VITAMIN D-3 WORKS to HELP THE IMMUNE SYSTEM FIGHT PATHOGENS!

One important thing about the latitude and covid death. After Netherlands it start trailing of. There is a reason for that. Most countries north of Netherlands and the UK have Vitamin D fortification.

Sweden sticks out quite significantly there up north. Sweden does have Vitamin D fortification. But there are two things that plays in. The Fortification in Sweden is softer than in Norway and Finland, and Sweden have a much higher Immigrant population double  wamy.

tar (from smoke) is a pathogen to pretty much all life (incl virusses). Could also be that smokers usually bring up sputum, bc of irritation of airways, which would then also faster transfer any viral or other pathogens out, leading to smaller chance of infection of tissue.

Also i remember earlier in the year that Dr Seheult mentioned bc of some medical research paper that smokers were less likely to get infected, but once infected had higher risk of complications.

The people that are smoking have less infection risk. The people that once smoked (quitters) have higher risk. They dont have the benefit of smoking anymore, while they still do have damage due to smoking.(depending ofc on how long, when they quit, etc)

Im not advising anyone to start to smoke, bc it has many downsides. It may also not be wise to quit right now, with covid. And if you quit, its probably better to do it in summer.

A High Carbohydrate (Sugar & Starch), Low Fat Diet prevents the absorption of Vitamin D, rendering  extra sunshine and Vitamin D3 supplementation ineffective.  It’s the high Insulin spike in the Blood from Carbohydrate consumption, particularly from Sugar, that prevents Vitamin D absorption, also leading to the Chronic Diseases of Metabolic Syndrome ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqutA1dXp4k&feature=youtu.be ), which include the Comorbidities of COVID-19. Think about that when having a Dessert, sugary Snack, or drinking Soda Pop, Fruit Juice, sugared Coffee/Ice Tea, or Alcohol...

UV-A does not provoke 'vitD' production. General rule of thumb is UV-B is effective for this purpose during peak hours (and not at all during local autumn & winter times). Between 6am and 9am there is not an effective amount of UV-B making it to your skin to provoke 'vitD' production. Depending on how pale or melaninated your skin is you need anywhere from 10mins - 30mins at solar noon to provoke 'vitd' production chain.,2020-12-11T01:41:51Z,ANGslave,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR0ldUOTFdjdKLyKpLVNPq11pHubR1f34pCNg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Ugzwgp1RfwfeFy2nYFJ4AaABAg,0,ha2mLz-Xdpg,"Very good summary, should be watched by all doctors. Most of them (especially non-endocrinologists) will still be holding on to very conservative, probably obsolete official guidelines on vitamin-D... HOWEVER, I still wonder why research and measurement practice are so focussed on 25-OH Cholecalciferol levels when it is actually the 1,25-OH Calcitriol that is thought to be the active form making the difference? After all, the 25-OH cholecalciferol-based data can be misleading because the two-stage hydroxylization process depends on an individual's level of required enzymatic co-factors as well as functional status of the liver and kidneys.
As for the ingestion of very high doses of cholecalciferol plateauing at effective blood levels, I'd speculate that this is because the cholecalciferol has still to get from the intestines into the blood, so there's a bottle neck. Some recommendation floating around on the Internet is that oral supplements should always be taken with very oily food to help the transfer from guts to blood.",2020-12-11T00:03:29Z,nematube,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRbEJNUhBaJjMGST-N8aw67Vn9v0U6jwkBr4w=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

To my knowledge, steroid hormones are created from cholesterol, the precursor to all the steroid hormones such as progesterone, testosterone, and all the estrogens, among others. If I understand correctly from other doctors I’ve learned from, sunlight hits the skin, mixing with the cholesterol in the skin to create Vitamin D3. 

This past summer I spent half an hour in the sun every day with 90% of my skin exposed. I took 5,000 - 10,000 IU of a D3 and K2 combo supplement daily. My D3 went from 50 to 83 (US measurement), never having been higher than 50 for five decades. This was a huge help in rebuilding my immune system, along with laying on the earth (highly healing) and recovering from the virus which I contracted in February. After watching this presentation, I now know in the summer taking 5,000 IU is probably enough based on the graph of diminishing returns for uptake close to the end of the video.
