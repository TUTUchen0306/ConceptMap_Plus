so now you read

sounds good ey?

but then you can read

Here's the issue: We have 16 bits in total. If we just look at single bit errors, that gives us 16 bits which could possibly be affected, right? You might now think that you need 16 possible states to describe this like this: 1: error in bit 1, 2: error in bit 2, 3: error in bit 3, ... 16: error in bit 16. But we actually need 1 more. Because there's also the possibility that there is no error anywhere. That means there are 16+1=17 possible states. 16 for each of the bits having an error and one extra for no error at all. 
But we only have 4 parity bits which means they can only store 2^4=16 possible states. 17>16, so this doesn't work. By cutting out the 1st bit you reduce the total number of bits to 15, so the total number of states is 15+1=16 which works perfectly.",2020-11-28T13:54:04Z,Lünkel,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ-qMgvPfdSJOhmsTFABfnbrzd-EpjRmejKEvs88w=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

A couple small rabbit trails:
- Does this relate to holographic technology? I know that the information in a hologram (or is it holograph?) is spread throughout the image, so take one part out or taint it, and the whole image still exists and can be brought out of areas where the information has not been damaged/tainted.
- Have you ever heard the conjecture that both the Bible and DNA seem to engage in a form of error-correcting and holographic behavior?

I'm a highly visual thinker and I've noticed this most of my life. The symbolic elitism of maths, in particular, is woefully evident on Wikipedia, and I shudder to think how many highly intelligent people think themselves useless at maths because the standard pedagogy is so maximally opaque.

Richard Feynman shared both this condition of thinking visually and an intense dislike for said elitism. In one of his lectures, on the wave mechanics of light reflection in terms of phases, he talked for about 10 minutes solid about a mathematical description based on complex numbers - without ONCE uttering the phrase ""complex number"".

UgyJKr--pmCqLGK7OJp4AaABAg,0,X8jsijhllIA,"This is advanced binary math. But it is fascinating because the implication of these math are really useful, not just an adult trying to impress people with useless games.
And the result is borderline magical, normally a taboo in science.
Somebody was asking are to read 11 bit here, write 15 bit there.
You use functions already written which accept the size in bit.
For example, binmemcpy(source, destination, size)
But the address source is expressed in binary bit instead of bytes.
So, suppose I copy 13 bit in an array. The starting address is zero, but the address where will be copied the following bits will be:
Byte : 1, bit 5
The next call, binmemcpy(source, 13, ...)
Meaning, take the bit from the source, copy starting at binary location 13...
We know 13 has to become byte 1, bit 5. How do we computer that?
Let say bindesti = 13
ByteAddress = bindesti >> 3
BitDesti = bindesti & 0x07
Let's check if that work.
BinDesti in hexadecimal is 0x0D
In binary, 00001101
Notice the 3 bit to the right, D2-D0=0b101 which is 5
Brief, bit D2-D0 contain the bit position and all other bit are the actual memory address in byte.",2020-09-14T03:58:57Z,Christian Gingras,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSXXGK0_Z6BrB-Cw3ojgCYVZyXHTF-BJHF_5PUX=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgyEWZodCi61gSxzcsJ4AaABAg,0,X8jsijhllIA,"I have a question about an intuition that I had : by rearranging the string of bits from a line (1D) to a grid (2D) it was possible to use a small number of ""security bits"" (""sb"") to secure a large number of ""information bits"" (""ib""), the ratio ""sb/ib"" becoming exponentially smaller as the total number of bits grows larger. In the case of a grid, for N ""ib"" you would need about Log2(N) ""sb"".

Then wouldn't it be possible to arrange the initial string of bits into cubic grids (3D) or even grids of higher dimension than that ? I know it's impractical to imagine with small examples like 12bits blocks as shown in this video, it's more useful to think of values of N in the range of billions or even more.

I mean, the benefit would be small since Log4(1.000.000.000.000) ~ 20 and Log2(1.000.000.000.000) ~ 40, so a difference of 20 bits in a total of 10^12 bits is ridiculously negligeable, but my question was more about the possibility than about the practicality

Instead of using 16 spaces, let's use 64 spaces, like in the chess example. If we represent these 64 spaces in 2D, we'd get 8 rows and 8 columns. We'd need 3 bits to indicate the row, 3 bits to indicate the column, and the 0th bit for control (since it doesn't fall in any of the rows or columns that are being checked), for a total of 7 bits.

Now if we represent 64 spaces in 3D, we'd get 4 rows, 4 columns and 4 z-levels.

UgyMb279NYD5j0HwpfV4AaABAg,0,X8jsijhllIA,"Ok I puased at 3:20 and gave it go here's what I came up with (I don't think it's what he'll say, but if it is this would be a waste of time to write out):
TL;DR I managed to get it down to 16bits, but I haven't fully figured out how the 16bits check themselves without impossible assignments

Let's arrange all the bits in a square grid. If there are an even number of 1's in a row we assign it a 1. Otherwise it's assigned a 0. Do the same for the columns. If one bit is changed and we assign 1's and 0's to the rows and columns again, one row and one column will be changed too so now we know the changed bit's coordinates on the grid! For 256 bits, we would need 2(256)^.5=32 bits. This isn't efficient enough, but we can do better.
 If we arrange the bits in a cube the same logic will apply, but we assign 1's and 0's to a square layer instead of a row. For 256 bits we would need 3(256)^.(1/3)=19.04--should have remembered 256 isn't cubic--88... Ok so you can't use a cube for 256, but instead of a cube we can have a 4x8x8 prism which would require 4+8+8=20bits which is improvement!
 Now let's skip a couple dimensions to an 8 dimensional hyper cube. For 256 bits we would need 8(256)^(1/8)=16bits No!!! I was really banking on that being 8bits. Funny enough 4(256) ^(1/4)=16 so the skip didn't save any data!
I know I haven't wrapped it up (there's some interesting issues when trying to incorporate the redundant bits into the rest), but I gotta watch the rest of the video (and sleep) eventually!

If you ask me, a bit is really a fundamental unit of measurement: the unit of Information. What is a bit? I'd say it's not a 1 or 0, but rather than a bit should be defined as the answer to a yes or no question. When framed like this, the elegance of the solution becomes obvious. You have 16 cells, which can be addressed by 4 bits. Rather than treat the index of each cell as an opaque number, treat it like 4 yes-or-no questions. What are those questions? They were right there in the video! They're exactly the 4 questions that were used to narrow down where the error was. From this perspective, those 4 questions are what _define_ a 4 bit number.

Eacg card contains the numbers in one of the parity groups the hamming code uses, and by asking if they see the number on the card you're asking if there's a 1 in the corresponding bit position.   

I had a quick Google for when they were invented, I'd be interested to see if it was before Hamming invented his code...",2020-09-05T03:21:29Z,Joe Teague,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTOP8satnBYXHxFMGH1fPPCHRRh09De5PWNYyP5=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

UgzDALSk5LOz50xfTW94AaABAg,0,X8jsijhllIA,"Related to this is the Hamming distance, which is the minimum number of errors that will transform one valid message into another valid message. You can always detect any number of errors less than the Hamming distance, and if the number of errors is less than half the Hamming distance, you can correct the message to the nearest valid message.

Using no error correction the Hamming distance is 1. Using a parity bit the Hamming distance is 2. Using the Hamming Code the Hamming distance is 3. And using the Extended Hamming Code the Hamming distance is 4.

Using the Extended Hamming Code, a single error produces an invalid message adjacent to only a single valid message, allowing you to correct it. Two errors produces an invalid message that is right in between multiple valid messages, letting you know something went wrong but not how to fix it. Three errors can produce an invalid message that is adjacent to the wrong valid message, but it's incredibly unlikely that you have so many errors that you'll see three within the same 16 bit block of data.",2020-09-05T01:59:12Z,Alex Holker,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTOx8lqSrRTt-Pgf_L2b4YyM7RqMRrFZg8sBq-Z=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

For each card, card 2 for example, we have all the numbers below 2^N-1 that its binary digit with value 2 is 1,
i.e. 2,3,6,7,10,11 etc. and do it for all cards. And then, we ask a person to think of a number below 2^N-1 and show us which cards have that number, e.g. for 42, the cards 2,4,6 have 42, since (42)_2=101010. After that, we add up all the respective number of the cards that the person has pointed out (respective number = 2^{{card no.}}), and we get the number! (2+8+32=42 in this example)

UgwUH0iXhm68anDLYFZ4AaABAg,0,X8jsijhllIA,"Here's my intuitive grasp of this, probably totally wrong. This is all about transmitting information at different levels cohesively. It reminds me of the pseudo Hillbert curves, with the matrix being that curve. One level is the bytes, 1 and 0, and the next level is the even or odd nature of the matrix coming from adding up the 1's or 0's, the parity  is the new level of bytes. Then deriving 4 patterns from the matrix to work with is another level where the parity number takes part. The kicker for me is bringing in chaos theory (?) to see maybe that the a-periodic elements are the information, the periodic elements are like the background and as described by Sapolsky in his lecture 21 about chaos, with three chaotic (a-periodic) elements in a complex system having the effect of disrupting the system. So, what overcoming noise means, is to have 2 or 4 chaotic (information) elements but not three. It's kind of cool how this hamming codes thing is like Pitman shorthand, especially when the parity number is included and takes part, it seems to transcend a level, like the computer is for the codes, the brain is the focal point to translate spoken language into lines and squiggles and dots of Pitman, later to convert back into English or whatever.

Edit; my guess is that 8 lines of info (8 a-periodic elements) were tried but the fuzziness ruins the info because there's too many chances for that 3 element thing to happen (on a low level, but it still messes thing up) and what's needed is to do the same type of thing as including the parity while deriving 4 patterns from one, do this but on a much higher level of complexity.",2020-09-04T23:45:26Z,Project Malus,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRfijHIkJQHZqfWyeokbKRucu4mBhT5VzoNFB14=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Assign each bit to the elements of the finite field GF(256), which takes 8 bits. Then add them all up and that's your hamming code. Subtracting the final sum (after the bit flip) from the hamming code should give zero and if it doesn't, the answer is the flipped bit. 

For the two bit version, let the final 9th bit be a parity bit (set it equal to the parity of the block). If the parity bit doesn't match then there was one error. If the parity bit matches but the 8 bit error code says there was an error then there must be two errors.

There's just one more thing. In a finite field, there is an identity element. If that gets flipped, the 8 bit error correcting code will say there is no error, but the parity bit will say there was an error. Well there is only one possibility.

Ugy-IbqFtucKkwNumIh4AaABAg,0,X8jsijhllIA,"If all four party check pass, indicating no error - why does it mean there could still be an error at bit zero? Why not bit 15, or 13, or 3? Why does no error mean there could be an error; and why in bit zero? Why once you've passed your parity check - indicating no error - do you need a 17th bit to indicate ""no error""? You already are getting your indication of ""no error"". 

If our four parity bits indicate no error: why throw out bit 0? Why not bit 15 - the opposite corner, or bit 3, or bit 12? Why lose any bit?",2020-09-04T22:53:32Z,JoseCan,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTGrnu0-RMlS6g5TyB0lEDG_uf1FCDzEDhm_g=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj
Ugy-IbqFtucKkwNumIh4AaABAg.9DCMVjqjud-9DDcuOyjAhP,Ugy-IbqFtucKkwNumIh4AaABAg,X8jsijhllIA,"Take a look at the grid and the checks we chose again. Every single square is hit by at least 1 check, making it possible to detect an error there. Except for bit 0. It's not included in any of the checks, so if there's an error there we have no way to tell. Why not bit 15, 13 or 3? Because those *are* included in at least one check. 

So once we've passed all of our 4 parity checks, we know that all the tiles covered by at least one (so all but bit 0) are error free. But we have no clue about bit 0. So it could either be that there is no error at all or that there is an error at specifically bit 0. Number wise this also makes sense. We have 4 parity bits, allowing us to encode 16 different states. But there are 17 different states that the grid can take: one error on each of the 16 tiles and then no error. That means no matter how we choose these 4 bits, there's always at least some ambiguity.

As Grant advocates, go ahead and try it yourself. You'll see that you can't detect errors at specifically bit 0.",2020-09-05T10:44:49Z,Lünkel,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQ-qMgvPfdSJOhmsTFABfnbrzd-EpjRmejKEvs88w=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Ugxr9fQVchMkZ_Rn9TF4AaABAg,0,X8jsijhllIA,"Great video as always! This whole ""parity check"" algorithm reminds me of my favourite puzzle about 1000 barrels of wine. I'll write it here if someone wants to try solving it:

You are a wealthy king of a prosperous, medieval, absolute monarchy. Your daughter is getting married in 11 days (in the morning on the 12-th day from today). Understandably, to celebrate the occasion you organise a lavish wedding party. The main highlight of the planned event is 1000 kegs of the finest wine from overseas that you ordered. They arrived yesterday and you have been bragging about it to everyone who would listen.

Unfortunately, your spies inform you that your enemies secretly added poison to one of the kegs. The poison is so potent, that but a drop can easily kill a man. However, to avoid suspicion, the substance was chosen carefully. It doesn't kill instantly - you die after a week (on the 8-th day), showing no symptoms until then. 

Obviously you need to find and get rid of the poisoned keg before the wedding. Moreover, you absolutely can't waste more than 1 keg. You are certainly wealthy enough to afford a whole new batch, but it would certainly not arrive on time. Additionally, if more than 1 keg is missing, someone might notice - it would be a major hit to your prestige, position and rule - after all, as a ruller, perception is everything.

Fortunately, 10 criminals are being held in your dungeon for different crimes pending trial before you. Being a king you can do whatever you want with them - pardon them, kill them or... make them taste the wine.

Your task is simple - you need to find the poisoned keg before the wedding day, but how?
===========================================================================================

TL;DR - 1000 kegs, 1 poisoned. The poison kills on the 8-th day after ingestion. You have 10 prisoners you can force the wine upon. You need to find the poisoned keg in 11 days.

FAQ: 
-> A poisoned person dies on the 8-th day but NOT TO THE MINUTE. It could be after 7d + 1h or 7d+14h, you don't know.
-> There is no way to distinguish the poisoned wine from the normal wine. They smell, look, behave exactly the same.
-> You have only 11 days ""to work with"" - you can't f.ex. check the state of prisoners on the 12-th day, the mystery must solved by then.
-> There is no antidote for the poison.
-> The answer is an algorithm to solve the problem. It's not something along the lines of ""I ask the mage, and he divines it"" or ""I cancel the party""
-> From what I hear there is more than one way to solve it, however I only arrived at a single solution

And I have a small request - if you want to write your solution in the comment, please don't spoil the fun for others, write it on the 5-th line so that it's not visible before one clicks ""MORE"".

The square of bits encoding the information is like the square of head/tail coins on the chess board. Like in the riddle, this board encodes a certain position to be where the ""key"" is, and using the method explained in the solution to the riddle to locate the key position from the board layout, we would know if there is an error or not by making sure if the supposed ""key"" of the board layout is where it should be. If its not, well we know there was an error, and supposing its only a single error, we can track it down by reversing the riddle solution algorithm to find the bit we have to flip to have the ""key"" back in its original postion. If you think about it, it would take log base 2 of n amount of redundant bits to mark the location of the key, so a similar amount of redundant bits needed as the hamming code. I guess things get complicated if those redundant bits are where the error is though.

Spoiler below







The questions are based on which indices have a 1 in the same position it's in in the parity bit. This is why the parity bits are the powers of two, as they have a single 1 in them. This can also be seen as which indices, when passed with the parity index through a bitwise and, do not return 0. This bitwise and allows it to be so simple to program.",2020-09-04T17:39:04Z,DaComputerNerd,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRMtULfasd_GlMe7_Ksert2bNclY9giiYsqk3t2=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj
