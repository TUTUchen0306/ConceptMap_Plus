I was reflecting back on one project I worked on where the code ran on an IBM 370, there were many groups involved, each writing code with only a specification sheet. I later learned it was a government secret project, so one group didn't know much about any other, all we ever saw of other groups work was object code modules for the linker which got linked to our code. Software breaks, in several cases the code authoring group no longer existed (Legacy) and if there was source code it was classified, when we traced a fault to such an object module we often had to disassemble it to figure out what it was doing.

UgwqJJvKMf_v0ehAELB4AaABAg,0,L1ung0wil9Y,"Still changing the names of established barriers to optimization, I see. A resource contention that is causing a bottleneck is now called a Hazard.  In C we could wait on the resource and set a counter to come and check again. In C++ we could set semaphore to flag us when the resource is available.The compiler optimizer should manage resource contention, and not middle ware or app code. In my book a Hazard begats errors, crashes, data loss , downtime, and many sleepless nights. Why overly dramatize the loss of a dozen or two cycles? If you can't afford another $50 G for more parallelism, build smarter compilers, linkers, and 1st pass code scanners. These can work wonders. Work with your CPU consultant at the chip vendor. They have great ideas and they don't get no respect. Talk with them and go with extra buckets for the mind dump you're gonna get.

UgzqoHq3S-RKqh3v1JR4AaABAg,0,L1ung0wil9Y,"11:15 ""Vector operations tend to be faster than scalar operations."" Well, not as much as they used to. I have plots of DAXPY (y[i]=a*x[i]+y[i]) for different sizes of x and y on Intel and ARM architectures. Vector operations are much faster when x and y both fit into registers or L1. When they fit in L2, vector is still faster but not as much. When they only fit in L3 or memory, there is no difference in speed. Gather and scatter operations show no difference in speed (vector vs. scalar) regardless of cacheability. I haven't found an example where vector ops are slower, but I do have examples where vector and scalar ops are very similar in speed. Much different now than the CDC 7600, FPS-264, CRAY Y-MP and C-90 vector architectures of our younger days.

BTW, I love your work Dr. Leiserson. I was very happy to find this lecture. This topic is not taught enough. Please don't take my comments as a criticism.

There is, unfortunately, a religious belief among younger programmers without a solid computer science background that computer languages and compilers make programming easier. That is not the case. A language is simply a collection of shortcuts to achieve certain side-effects. It is, sort of, an implicit library to a set of often used algorithms. The exact same results can be achieved with explicit libraries of assembly level functions. What will be missing are the (extensive) compiler optimizations. An assembler programmer would have to work much harder to get the same level of optimization of out the code as is possible with a modern compiler.

I like to peek into 2 levels below and 2 levels above. I'll go all the way down to the transistors and how they are made within the realm of chemistry and physics all the way up to scripting languages such as Python.

If I was to design a Degree Program at an arbitrary University here's a road map or an outline for each level of abstraction:

Mathematics - General fields: Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus 1 and 2 at a minimum and maybe some Linear Algebra
Physics - Basic Newtonian up to some Quantum Mechanics including the beginning stages of Electricity and Simple Circuits
Chemistry - Basic Chemistry at the College Level primarily focused on the various chemicals and compounds that can act as conductors, insulators and inductors. (No need for Organic Chemistry)

This would cover that basics needed for Entry Level Electronic Engineering 

Mathematics - Analytical Geometry, Vector Calculus, more Linear Algebra, Lambda Calculus, Probability & Statistics, Logic - Boolean Algebra, Introduction to Truth Tables & Karnaugh Maps. 
Physics - Quantum Mechanics continued, deeper theories such as wave propagation
Circuit Design - Ability to both read and build electric diagrams or schematics using both DC and AC type currents learning about the differences between circuits components that are either in parallel or in series, voltage and current dividers. Also covering both Analog and Digital Electronic design patterns leading us into our Logic Gates.
Chemistry - Specialized on the components that make up your transistors, resistors, diodes, capacitors, rectifiers, and more...

Still no programming yet... 

Mathematics - More on Boolean Algebra and Discrete math that is Log2 Base mathematics (Binary Arithmetic and Logic calculations), Extended Truth Tables & Karnaugh Maps, State Machines covering both Mealy and Moore machines. Arbitrary Languages as Sets with a defined Alphabet.
Physics - building various digital circuits and analyzing them with voltage meters and oscilloscopes.
Chemistry - diving deeper into the components at the quantum levels

Mathematics - Complex Number Analysis, Euler's numbers and formulas, Fourier Series, Laplace Transforms, Signal Analysis and FFTs(Fast Fourier Transforms)... and more
Physics & Chemistry - maybe specialized fields at this point

Bringing it all together, your first day as a programmer, well hardware / software engineer! 

Digital Circuits I - Combinational Logic - Integrated Circuits and Complex Circuit Design building an adder, a multiplexer and demux or selector, comparators, binary counters.  
Digital Circuits II - Sequential Logic - Feedback loops, SR Latch, D-Latch, Flip Flop, JK Flip Flop, Toggle, Timers, Registers
Digital Circuits III - High and Low Logic, Synchronous vs Asynchronous, Bit Addressing, Memory and Data Paths
Digital Circuits IV - Putting It All Together (ISA Design) - Refresher on Truth Tables, Karnaugh Maps & State Machines. 
                                *Introduction to HDL and Verilog 
    **Any addition mathematics, physics or chemistry that is needed


ISA I - Basic Turing Machines - Implementing one on a breadboard then move to either Proto Board and or a PCB
ISA II - Pipelining
ISA III - Caches 
ISA IV - Branch Prediction
ISA V - Out of Order Execution
    **Any addition mathematics, physics or chemistry that is needed

Transition from Hardware to Software:
      - Building an Assembler, Disassembler and Hex Editor.
      - Learning about the C Language and Building a basic C Compiler, Linker & Debugger 
      - More Mathematics
 
*Advanced Courses: GPU(Graphical Processing) - APU(Audio Processing) design, Storage Design, Monitor or Display Design, I/O Peripheral Design (Keyboards and Mouse) these would be basic and simplified versions of what you can buy on the market, something that could theoretically be done on a breadboard and easily be done on something like either on a ProtoBoard,  PCB, of FPGA ... These may also include various classes related to Mechanical Engineering and other required mathematics, physics and chemistry courses.

Operating System Design (OSD)
OSD I - CMOS, Bios and or EFI/UEFI, Bootstrapper, the Kernel, the HAL and more basic features.
OSD II - Vector Tables, Memory Addressing and Mapping, Virtual Memory, Processes and Threads, I/O handling and Interrupts, and more...
OSD III - File Handling, Compression & Decompression, Encryption & Decryption
OSD IV - Drivers and Peripheral Support
OSD V - Graphics - Font and 2D Image Rendering, Audio and Networking (Ports)
OSD VI -  Generating an Installer
OSD VII - Installing and Configuring the OS for First USE, extending your C compiler to support C/C++ based on your assembly language. 

Using your homebrew built computer with your own OS and compiler and if you elected to build your own or just interface with I/O, storage, graphic and audio devices... now it's time to use them and put it to good use. We can now jump into basic Game Design by starting off with implementing DOOM in a combination of ASM, C and or C++ to test out your hardware. 

The final stages: Designing your own high level dynamic scripting or interpreted language using your custom built CPU-PC to write high level languages within it.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you can build your own CPU and ISA from the ground up, build your own basic assembler and compiler that is enough to be able to write, build, and run DOOM on it, design your own high level scripting language to work on it... Then I could easily say you have graduated and become both a Hardware and Software Engineer!

If I was coordinating a degree program at some university, something like this would be the outline for the Dual Bachelors/Masters Degree programs for both Software and Hardware Engineering. There may be some fields of mathematics, physics, etc. that I didn't cover here. Such as Data Sets, Algorithms, etc. which would be important yet I feel they would be more related towards the Computer Science side of things as opposed to the Engineering side of things. Yet to transition from the Bachelors to the Masters, the Bachelors in Computer Science side of things would be required. 

If one was to take every course available, they'd end up with a Masters for the following fields: Mathematics, Physics, Computational Chemistry, Computer Science, Software Engineering, Electrical-Electronic/Hardware Engineering, Operating System Design & Data Management and possibly a Bachelors in some of the follow: Mechanical Engineering, Data Structures & Algorithms, Information Theory, Compiler & OS Design and a few more...",2021-09-29T02:25:09Z,skilz8098,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRjUY4rO4k3WlhlnC9dqvmvblgkGmTO9sAVnBSE=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

I have seen some insanely stupid code written by ""young"" programmers. For example a customer counter was stored in an SQL database that was located in another machine in another building. Every time that counter was incremented, which was often in that application, meant a series of SQL instructions over a local area network. They had code like that yet still wondered why their million dollar Sun servers could only handle 70-80 web requests a second. Then occasionally the network connection would time out and the program would fail. I tried to mention that this was a silly idea but was told to stop being so negative and be a ""team player"".

Essentially, a direct jump states the jump destination address in the instruction i.e. the next value in the PC is the immediate address in the instruction.
An indirect jump includes a pointer to an address, which in turn contains the destination address i.e. the next value in the PC is the value stored in the immediate address of the instruction.

Three things if you include cost, but in HPC the cost of the hardware is always balanced against the cost of the calculation, so if it costs four times as much to get a machine that can do ten times as much work in the same time period, the hardware cost isn't really a problem. Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is small, low-power and cheap, and you can have a lot of it, but it's relatively slow and requires periodic refreshing (meaning it can't be immediately available at every clock cycle). Static RAM requires more components per bit, and uses power continuously rather than just on refreshes. You can have a little bit of it _very_ close to where it's being used (remember that _it_ _takes_ _time_ for signals to get from one place to another, and moving things apart to make room for fast memory is going to slow other things down), a little bit more a little less close, and quite a bit a little bit further away. (L3 cache on most current processors is bigger than the _total_ memory in most computers of, say, 30 years ago.) Going to ""chiplet"" construction means that it's feasible to put more cache in while keeping fabrication yields reasonable, but it's not going to get you to, say, 16GB of chip-speed SRAM cache any time soon.

1. Assembly language 0:22
- Why we want to have a look the assembly language 6:46
- Expectation of students 10:05
- If you really want to understand something, you should understand one level below what you normally need to use 12:20
2. X86-64 ISA primer 13:28
- 4 important concept: Registers 14:03, Instructions 20:25, data types 28:15 and memory addressing modes 35:50
- Assembly idiom 43:08
3. Floating-point and vector hardware 47:54: SIMD
4. Overview of computer architecture 56:55
- Historically, computer architects have aimed to improve processor performance by exploit parallelism (e.g. instruction-level parallelism (ILP), vectorization, multicore) and locality (caching)
- ILP 1:00:35: pipelining, pipeline stall, hazards
- Superscalar processing 1:09:08
- Out-of-order execution 1:11:40: bypassing, from in-order to out-of-order, register renaming
- Branch prediction 1:15:44: speculative execution",2020-11-30T20:06:14Z,Lei Xun,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTOAy1Co88DItaJzNpi4NG8Awz0QQV7LsJAY4347Q=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj
