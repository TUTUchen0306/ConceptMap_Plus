I can imagine it with 3d graphics though,2021-09-30T08:28:30Z,Jay Kay,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSwpUc7UsqiJPDTnH8rOjx673I8OhMzNPzwCyII=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj
UgyHSafxpGOlWvuRg4F4AaABAg,0,OQ5jsbhAv_M,"THE BALANCED, ULTIMATE, TOP DOWN, AND CLEAR MATHEMATICAL PROOF REGARDING THE FACT THAT E=MC2 IS F=MA:


Time dilation ultimately proves ON BALANCE that E=mc2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Time is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE. Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy.

Great !!!! QUANTUM GRAVITY !!!! E=MC2 IS F=ma. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. What are the EARTH/ground AND the SUN are CLEARLY E=MC2 AND F=ma IN BALANCE. Very importantly, outer ""space"" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. It does ALL CLEARLY make perfect sense. GOT IT !!!! THE SKY is BLUE, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. Great !!! Now, think about the man who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Perfect !!!!

Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. ""Mass""/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. (ACCORDINGLY, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution !!!) Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. TIME DILATION ultimately proves ON BALANCE that E=MC2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. News flash ! Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy, AS E=MC2 IS F=MA. The Earth (A PLANET) is a MIDDLE DISTANCE form that is in BALANCED relation to the Sun AND the speed of light (c), AS the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY !!!

Ugzo8r5JLL8xOXNpErB4AaABAg,0,OQ5jsbhAv_M,"I studied computer science at one of Cal state university.
It is middle tier school.
I took Pascal in 88. The professor had BS from Cal tech n MS n PhD from UCLA.
That was the reason I took that class. It was introductory program class.
The second was inter prime gap:: give the distribution Numbers of the gap between each prime based on input number. This is an illustration of array.
I told him to determine if 53 is a prime was divide 53 from loop 1 to 53.
He said that was the dumbest idea!.
Anyway, I think it bottom up DP. For 53, I have to check 3 5 7.
I had to build array of prime numbers as I go along.
I Stop if I find oUt it is not prime or square root of 53.
He told me I cannot use square root.
Be honest, I am average.
I already took Pascal n learn BASIC in high school.
Back in 80, few people learn program Ming. Not many people had PC.
I knew array n loop.
Many of classmates were struggling in loop n array let along math part.
One time, couple students complain the difficulties.
The professor said in Harvard, MIT, school assumed you know coding. They would Not babysit array n loop. 
We looked each other, if we were good enough to go to Harvard MIT, we wouldn't be there.
Oh he has Not taught us procedures. That was next project. People already suffered.
I did not learn recursive until next course.
I learn a lot from him.
Most students just couldn't stand Him. He always looked down at us. He even said all of us cheated on math teSt. The prerequisite of this class is algebra. That was his impression on us. He did like couple students over decades of teaching. Those were good enough to get PhD.

I got F's all the time.  Then, I entered the university on a faculty that had ""mathematical"" in its name. I was terrible in anything  math and programming related. I had lowest grades in stats and algebra. I was close to being expelled from the university because of my math.analysis grades. Until I spent a night cramming all this shit and theorems and I got A on a re-sit. When I quit the exam  room  I totally forgot everything. I wasn't happy with it. I hated it. 
Now I ended up being a programmer and then a  data scientist.  I write a terrible code. And I hate it , too.  I can't understand what's wrong with my life now.
I have a constant feeling  that I'm only worth something if I do something connected with math and programming.  I cant understand my life. Nor my possible career path.

UgzR_GMvXw24jT0w9814AaABAg,0,OQ5jsbhAv_M,"K, so here is one question/concept that seems to arise from this lecture. If you can traverse an expansive abstract DAG from the bottom up (base case/root to solution), then you have a nice linear solution without memoization that you probably never really needed dynamic programming for. If you can't, you try to recurse backwards to create a similar linearity. Recursing backwards while memoizing repeated computations in a hypothetical call tree, i.e. utilizing optimal substructure to create this effective linearity while consuming linear memory.
My question would be: is there a notion of forward, reverse or both optimal substructure? Let's say a sorted list would seem to have both. You can easily follow it from either end to the other. This is a hard concept to express as a question. But if the best solution can be found from guessing from the first node forward or from the last node backwards, what makes one more efficient than the other?",2019-07-22T22:37:55Z,IWillTakeAGuranteeOfBetterOverAPromiseOfPerfect,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSVfQC6tTKYmREpAMYRuqpKNSxEFWXxhkqfMTd3=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

Ugzcnm-mYsijj--gDMp4AaABAg,0,OQ5jsbhAv_M,"I'm an old-time programmer who learned his trade in the trenches, not at school, and all this seems unnecessarily complicated to me. Recursion is conceptually elegant, but inefficient if for no other reason that it requires the overhead of a function call to do what could be done in a simple loop using local variables. The ""memoization"" idea seems to involve creating a global variable as a way of sneaking local variables past the thought police. 

When it comes down to it, everything boils down to machine code, and the most efficient algorithm is the one that requires the fewest instruction cycles. We weren't necessarily worse programmers than the computer scientists, but we had to contend with real-world limitations. Primitive equipment required primitive methods. 

The first computer I worked with had 4000 6-bit characters of core storage (aka RAM), instruction timings in milliseconds, and no OS. A good programmer was one who could squeeze every ounce of performance out of that beast, and since the biggest program you could write wasn't much more than 1000 lines, if that, you didn't have to worry about spaghettification, memory management and all the rest of it. We evolved as the equipment evolved, and we came up with methods that the computer scientists might have learned from.

* If we'd pass the fib[k-1] (as f_in_previous_iteration), 
* * then we wouldnt need to go and find it from far-away memory. Anyway memory access is more expensive than most think.
* * * includes removing the need to calc address &fibKm1 = &fib + k - 1;
* the check: if k <= 2: f=1;     can be moved out from the for-loop. IF statement is generally bad practice anyway (stops all blocks of CPU that depend on it)
* * have 2 functions, 1st does k==1 or ==2 and the rest and the rcursive part never checks it, just starts from 3
* range(1; n+1).   N+1 is constant and should be calculated once per fib() call
* * do you mean while k < n + 1? Or actually the last iteration would calc N+1 and give wrong answer?
* variable f is irrelevant - could just use f[k] everywhere
* For  f[k] actually &f + k    is done on CPU
* * pointer arithmetics would be faster as this instruction is not needed.

C++ proto-code for those 1st thoughts:

int  f[N] = {1, 1};    // fill first with 1st 2 numbers = 1
int* const fEnd = f+N;
int* f_m2 = f++;    // pointer to fib[k-2]
int* f_m1 = f++;   // pointer to fib[k-1]
while (++f < fEnd) {
     *f = *f_m1 + *f_m2; // use pointers to get & set
       f_m2++; f_m1++; // inc all 3 pointers
}

But that's involved small teams and a massive focus on any performance optimizations possible (a runtime reduction of only a few percent can mean the difference between playable frame rates and a juddery mess).

1. One for function results
2. One for unfinished functions.

Then your logic would have to see that you are asking for the result of something not yet finished, and then track the number of times you've hit it because at some point you either will indefinitely hit it OR you will be close to finishing OR you will have an unsolvable problem OR you went down the wrong tree branch...the problem there is then you have to have intuition, which without AI, your code cannot do even decently...you leave the realm of Dynamic Programming and enter into Artificial-Intelligence/Machine-Learning or requiring manual inputs.

The graph versions allows one to both visually (when creating the algorithm) and logically (when applying it) determine which cyclic recurrences are indefinite-recursions/infinite-loops and which ones are part of the shortest path. *Sometimes* a short or *THE SHORTEST* path might include a repetition such as:

So, given a more detailed/complex problem space, having too many recursions can actually kill your program's speed (assuming unlimited or near unlimited stack space pre-allocated for method params/data) OR even worse, it could cause an issue known as *stack-overflow* by going over the number of items that can rest on the stack before you must begin emptying it or resolving recursions. Infinite method chaining/recursions can quickly overflow the stack, but so, too can a complex recursion tree that never resolves or fails to resolve in a reasonable number of recursions.

It all just depends on what you are doing and how deep you can go vs how you can mitigate known issues beforehand. But, he did cover this briefly towards the beginning where he added in the caveat that assumes your hashing algorithm is good enough to be represented by a near constant lookup time. As long as your hashing algorithm used (if using dictionary or hash) is better than 3 levels of recursion, then you are already optimized i that sense.

But, if you don't learn the mechanics behind the technique, then it won't matter whether full-blown brute-force recursion or memoization supported recursion/looping is better because you'll only have 1 of the two tools necessary...and you know what they say about only having a hammer?
