L1ung0wil9Y,"Interesting! I, much like the professor, started by doing most software projects in assembly code. Over the years I learned many, once you get the hang of one, others come more easily. I was reflecting back on one project I worked on where the code ran on an IBM 370, there were many groups involved, each writing code with only a specification sheet. I later learned it was a government secret project, so one group didn't know much about any other, all we ever saw of other groups work was object code modules for the linker which got linked to our code. Software breaks, in several cases the code authoring group no longer existed (Legacy) and if there was source code it was classified, when we traced a fault to such an object module we often had to disassemble it to figure out what it was doing. Our group usually wrote in IBM370 assembly, but we soon discovered that other groups had used many different languages - you can recognize compiler constructs after a while. Some code was written in C, FORTRAN, PL1,  COBOL, even FORTH and assembly. Once we figured out what was broken, we had to write a patch for that object module - remember it was legacy code - no",2022-03-28T02:40:59Z,Velin,https://yt3.ggpht.com/h0wJoqeMFF_lx8gAK_6GkgA9HpaseNOSh4g8VvTrSDo2ffBMxFG6_mZiUz2BZ-ywi8FPAGEl=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

L1ung0wil9Y,"Still changing the names of established barriers to optimization, I see. A resource contention that is causing a bottleneck is now called a Hazard.  In C we could wait on the resource and set a counter to come and check again. In C++ we could set semaphore to flag us when the resource is available.The compiler optimizer should manage resource contention, and not middle ware or app code. In my book a Hazard begats errors, crashes, data loss , downtime, and many sleepless nights. Why overly dramatize the loss of a dozen or two cycles? If you can't afford another $50 G for more parallelism, build smarter compilers, linkers, and 1st pass code scanners. These can work wonders. Work with your CPU consultant at the chip vendor. They have great ideas and they don't get no respect. Talk with them and go with extra buckets for the mind dump you're gonna get.

I find it really baffling that all the major crypto YouTubers are just looking at pure waves and completely ignoring the broader narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook may not be as optimistic as it seems. It's kind of irresponsible to ignore the fact that every ETF launch so far has caused a major spike in BTC's spike. Already on shaky ground with historically low volumes and near-pure whale pumps, we narrowly avoided a long-term bear market. This is the worst time in history to invest as so many are not backing up their crypto assets. Day trading should be given more attention as it is less affected by the unpredictability of the market.

L1ung0wil9Y,"11:15 ""Vector operations tend to be faster than scalar operations."" Well, not as much as they used to. I have plots of DAXPY (y[i]=a*x[i]+y[i]) for different sizes of x and y on Intel and ARM architectures. Vector operations are much faster when x and y both fit into registers or L1. When they fit in L2, vector is still faster but not as much. When they only fit in L3 or memory, there is no difference in speed. Gather and scatter operations show no difference in speed (vector vs. scalar) regardless of cacheability. I haven't found an example where vector ops are slower, but I do have examples where vector and scalar ops are very similar in speed. Much different now than the CDC 7600, FPS-264, CRAY Y-MP and C-90 vector architectures of our younger days.

BTW, I love your work Dr. Leiserson. I was very happy to find this lecture. This topic is not taught enough. Please don't take my comments as a criticism.

L1ung0wil9Y,"1:00:06 Here's a point where he misspoke on memory vs. registers: ""I would say also the fact that you have a design with registers, that also reflects locality. cuz thwat that the processor wants to do things is fetch stuff from memory, doesn't want to operate on it in memory, that's very expensive, it wants to fetch things into memory [he meant registers], get enough of them there that you can do some calculations, do a whole bunch of calculations, and then put them back out there [to memory].""


This reminds me of the February 1984 BYTE Magazine, in an interview with the original Macintosh system-level programmers, one of them said of writing efficient code for the Mac's 68000 processor, ""keep the registers full."" The hit (time delay) of accessing main memory vs. a register wasn't nearly as bad back then, but keeping as much data in registers as you can keeps from having to swap out a lot of data to main memory.",2021-09-15T03:13:58Z,Ben Bradley,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTFZlrLJpRPKQorfg1gFhwxT5r_GpJI-xfvHuzS=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj
