EH6vE97qIP4,"Our world has 3 fundamental practices that are problematic. 

If we dont understand the root causes of a problem we will address the symptoms or the actors, not the causes.

The 1st is that large private and Central banks have obtained the Exclusive franchise to create ALL new Currency as Debt, with interest attached. 

An increasing population needs an increasing currency, but it is all created as a debt bearing interest. 
This indebts the whole world, every person, every government, in totally unpayable debts,  enslaving us all to bankers through personal debt or ever increasing excessive taxation, surcharges, permits, licences, registrations, regulations, fees, rates, duties,  fines,  levies,  adinfinitum, of which an increasing volume goes straight to the debt creators, who created it for free. (At zero cost to themselves.)

2nd. Virtually no limitation plus fractional banking allows banks to create massive new Currency,  blowing massive bubbles (housing/stocks) which devalues everyone's savings and work by raising all prices.  

The fix ? 

Stop all banks and financial institutions loaning out more than they have on deposit.  Return legal currency creation to national treasury departments with a zero Inflation policy.  

This will not create inflation like some bankers/economists would like to have you think.  It is not WHO creates currency that drives the constant devaluation of your money & work,  it is THE VOLUME per population and productivity. 
The banks increased the base currency supply by over 45 % since March 2020. This is further multiplied by fractional banking. You can't spend it off planet, and we've had no increase in population or productivity. How can it not devalue our savings, wages and retirement funds by around 50% as it enters the economy ?

3rd. Fiat currency whether paper or digital has no intrinsic value, thus it cannot be used as a long term store of value, particularly in an ever expanding fiat system.

The fix ?

Return to constitutional Silver, Gold, Copper & Nickle currency, designated by weight not cents/dollars. These will find their own local value.  These can't be printed to oblivion, have intrinsic value, and are a safeguard against selfish human nature.  Continue to keep the manufacture of Gold & Silver rounds by private mints & foundries to help keep the government mints honest as to premiums.

Correct these 3 Principles and >80 % of a nation's problems would disappear. Do not allow your masters the Debt slave creator's to tell you it can't be done.  It is easily done.  Beware. The WEF wants you totally enslaved with digital currency.

Otherwise, prepare for destruction.

Seek to understand these 3 practices. Check on if I have stated them accurately for yourself.  Then Print this out, and share, Tweet, post.    Only we can save ourselves  !

These 3 paragraphs can change the world and get you and your family out of endless peasantry.",2022-02-20T12:00:08Z,Mr Me,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTQXQvASsP-tPckdps4ullYngKXjpWG9_B8-vHbxYB05rXpnp5EOiRxqQeBXN_R=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj
EH6vE97qIP4,"The U.S. constitutional monetary system used real money [""gold and silver Coin""] as evidence of wealth.  Under the U.S. constitutional monetary system, the national debt could be PAID DOWN (as it was after World War I) or even PAID OFF (as it was during the Presidency of the 7th President, Andrew Jackson).  No action required, except to preserve, protect, and defend the U.S. constitutional monetary system.  Unfortunately, the U.S. today is saddled with a completely unconstitutional debt-based fiat system that uses debt AS IF it were money.  Under this debt-based fiat system, the national debt can NEVER be repaid, or even substantially paid down, because only debt is being used as money.  If there were NO debt, there would be NO ""money""!  So, under this debt-based fiat system, the national debt can only be DEFAULTED OUTRIGHT or, more likely, DISCHARGED with worthless currency.  The national debt [and unfunded liabilities] can thereby be eliminated completely -- along with the Middle Class!  Comprehensive Monetary & Banking Reform is required ASAP, to begin phasing out the Federal Reserve and restoring the constitutional monetary system based on ""gold and silver Coin"" and establishing an honest, 100%-reserve banking system compatible with it.  #ENDTHEFED  https://youtu.be/M1V0jqT1_SY",2022-02-20T06:57:27Z,Diana McGinnis,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLRQpvNxQMrB47QHKpHqCIVMdboKzZQc0LpwDKOp=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

EH6vE97qIP4,"23:38…on the role of money…they overlooked one really big aspect of our current money system:  it is also a form of power in which the rich subjugate the poor.  This is why blockchain money being decentralized is so key and why it scares the hell out of those who manipulate valuations using a central bank construct.  The central bank system gives way too much power to the hands of a few…they print money, screw around with interest rates and then tighten up and destroy whole sectors of an economy….essentially, manipulate a boom-bust cycle allowing those on the inside to profit from the whimsical moves of a central bank, which they control behind the scenes.",2022-01-23T19:58:32Z,Commenter2001,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQB7f5ytt0faYVrY4hjGcRYL_JZWH-Z-oX5RQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj

EH6vE97qIP4,Why isn't the whole stock market system using blockchain technology to insure that there are no market manipulation and creation of synthetic shares in the market.  As of now we know the hedge funds and stock market as a whole has no clue how many shares are actually being exchanged.  This is different than knowing how many are in the float.  When the float is traded over and over again....it should flag a margin call across the board.,2022-01-21T03:17:41Z,Heroes of Mormon,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTCX9WQRZ2ubWQE1-uivZLlo_Xce2ukLSWCl65ztg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj
